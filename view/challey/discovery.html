  const md = "# Challey - Discovery Document\n## Business Analyst Phase 1 Report\n\n**Project:** Challey\n**Client:** Maggie (age 13)\n**BA Agent:** Business Analyst\n**Date:** February 10, 2026\n**Status:** Discovery Complete (Skills 1-8)\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nChalley is a chore tracking and reward management app designed for families with teenagers. The client, Maggie (13), enjoys doing chores but lacks an effective way to communicate completed work to her parents. The app will create a simple, direct workflow: Dad assigns chores with associated rewards → Maggie completes them → Maggie marks them done → Dad verifies → reward given.\n\nThis discovery phase analyzed the competitive landscape, user needs, and technical feasibility to define a focused MVP that delivers on Maggie's core need while remaining simple enough for a first-time app creator to understand and use.\n\n---\n\n## Skill 1: Intake (Client Brief)\n\n**What Maggie Told Us:**\n> \"I enjoy doing chores. But I have no way of reporting what I have done to my parents. I need a way for my dad to assign chores to me. When he assigns chores I want him to also put in some rewards I would like. Whenever I complete chores, I will mark them as complete. And then whenever he sees my work done he can reward me.\"\n\n**Key Requirements Extracted:**\n- Two user types: Parent (Dad) and Kid (Maggie)\n- Parent assigns chores\n- Parent defines rewards per chore\n- Kid marks chores complete\n- Parent verifies completed work\n- Parent grants rewards\n- Reporting/visibility of completed work\n\n**What Makes This Special:**\nMaggie ENJOYS chores (rare for teens!) — the problem isn't motivation, it's **communication and recognition**. She wants her parents to see and acknowledge her contributions.\n\n---\n\n## Skill 2: Market Research\n\n### Current Market Landscape (2026)\n\nThe chore app market is mature with 15+ established players. Apps fall into three categories:\n\n#### Category 1: Financial Education Focus\n**Examples:** Greenlight, BusyKid, Homey\n**Features:** Integrated banking, allowance tracking, savings goals, investment education\n**Pricing:** $4.99-$14.98/month\n**Target:** Parents teaching financial literacy alongside chores\n\n#### Category 2: Comprehensive Household Management\n**Examples:** S'moresUp, Family Daily, OurHome\n**Features:** Chores + calendars + grocery lists + family messaging + IoT integration\n**Pricing:** Free basic, $4.99/month premium\n**Target:** Busy families needing an \"all-in-one\" solution\n**Note:** S'moresUp even integrates with smart appliances (e.g., dishwasher assigns \"empty me\" chore)\n\n#### Category 3: Simple Chore Trackers\n**Examples:** Chorsee, Neat Kid, Family Tools, Chap\n**Features:** Core chore assignment, completion tracking, basic rewards\n**Pricing:** Free or low-cost ($1.99-$4.99 one-time or monthly)\n**Target:** Families wanting straightforward task management without complexity\n\n### Market Gaps & Opportunities\n\n**What's Missing:**\n1. **Teen-first design** — Most apps target younger kids (6-12) with gamification (monsters, points, cartoons). Teens want something more mature and respectful.\n2. **Simplicity over features** — Many apps suffer from feature bloat. Users report confusion navigating multiple tabs for calendars, allowances, savings jars, etc.\n3. **Recognition focus** — Apps emphasize rewards/money but not acknowledgment/appreciation, which research shows is a key motivator for teens.\n4. **Low/no-cost entry** — Most quality apps require subscriptions ($50-$180/year). Teens may not have credit cards or want ongoing costs.\n\n**Challey's Angle:**\nA **teen-friendly, minimalist chore tracker** that prioritizes clear communication and recognition over financial education or household management bells and whistles. Think \"simple, fast, awesome\" (Maggie's words).\n\n---\n\n## Skill 3: Competitive Analysis\n\n### Top 5 Competitors Deep Dive\n\n| App | Strengths | Weaknesses | Pricing | Target Age |\n|-----|-----------|------------|---------|------------|\n| **Chorsee** | Very simple interface, laser-focused on chores/allowances, easy setup, customizable task lists | Limited to chores only (no extras), basic design | Free basic, $2.99/month premium | 8-17 |\n| **Homey** | Detailed allowance features (per-minute rates, interest, fines), photo tasks, flexible family sizes | Complex financial math may overwhelm simple needs, premium required for 4+ users | Free (≤3 users), $4.99/month or $49.99/year unlimited | 6-16 |\n| **S'moresUp** | ChoreAI auto-assignment, smart appliance integration, comprehensive family tools (calendar, playdates, goals) | Feature overload for simple needs, \"Swiss Army knife\" approach can be confusing | Free standard, $4.99/month premium | 5-18 |\n| **Greenlight** | Banking integration, debit card for kids, strong financial education | Expensive ($5-$15/month), requires bank account setup, overkill if you just need chore tracking | $4.99-$14.98/month | 8-18 |\n| **Family Tools** | 100% free, completely ad-free, reward points for app customization | Basic feature set, fewer customization options | Free | 5-15 |\n\n### Competitive Positioning\n\n**Where Challey Fits:**\n- Simpler than S'moresUp/Homey (no banking, calendars, or IoT)\n- More teen-focused than Neat Kid/ChoreMonster (no cartoons or kid gamification)\n- Cleaner UX than Chorsee (modern, fast, intuitive)\n- Free/low-cost alternative to Greenlight/BusyKid\n\n**Key Differentiators:**\n1. **Teen-centric design language** (mature, respectful, not childish)\n2. **Recognition-first** (visible completed work, easy parent acknowledgment)\n3. **Fast workflow** (minimal taps from assignment to reward)\n4. **No subscription lock-in** (one-time purchase or free with limits)\n\n---\n\n## Skill 4: User Research\n\n### Primary Users\n\n#### User Type 1: The Teen (Maggie)\n**Age:** 13-17\n**Persona:** \"The Contributor\"\n\n**Needs:**\n- Easy way to show parents what she's accomplished\n- Clear visibility into assigned chores and associated rewards\n- Quick \"mark as done\" action from mobile\n- Sense of recognition and appreciation\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- Parents don't see completed work unless told verbally\n- Forgetting which chores have rewards\n- Feeling like contributions go unnoticed\n- Complex apps with too many screens/options\n\n**Motivations:**\n- Earning rewards (money, privileges, treats)\n- Feeling valued and trusted\n- Autonomy (choosing when to do chores within deadline)\n- Avoiding nagging/conflict with parents\n\n**Quote from Research:**\n> \"Teenagers want to feel valued, and when a chore is a responsibility and not just a menial task, it can help your teen feel more important.\"\n\n#### User Type 2: The Parent (Dad)\n**Age:** 35-55\n**Persona:** \"The Delegator\"\n\n**Needs:**\n- Fast way to assign chores from phone\n- Verification mechanism before granting rewards\n- Visibility into what's done vs. pending\n- Ability to set clear expectations upfront\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- \"I'll do it later\" syndrome (chores don't get done)\n- Constant reminders and nagging\n- Disputes about whether chores were done or done well\n- Tracking who did what in busy household\n\n**Motivations:**\n- Teaching responsibility and work ethic\n- Reducing household management burden\n- Maintaining peace (less arguing about chores)\n- Rewarding good behavior fairly\n\n**Quote from Research:**\n> \"While teenagers know what their chores are, they don't do them unless told, then respond with 'later, I'm busy now,' and often never get to it, leading to frustration and raised voices.\"\n\n### Secondary Insights\n\n**Teen Brain Development:**\nResearch notes that teenage prefrontal cortex (rational thought, consequences) is underdeveloped — teens need **clear structure, timing, and autonomy** to succeed with chores, not just threats or rewards.\n\n**Money as Motivator:**\nBiggest motivator for teens is money, but recognition/appreciation runs a close second. Both matter.\n\n**Scheduling Complexity:**\nTeens juggle school, extracurriculars, social life — chore apps need flexibility for WHEN chores happen, not just IF they happen.\n\n---\n\n## Skill 5: Feature Definition\n\n### Core Features (MVP)\n\n#### For Parents:\n1. **Create Chore** — Title, description, optional due date, assigned user, reward amount/type\n2. **View Chore Board** — See all active chores (pending, in progress, awaiting verification)\n3. **Verify Completion** — Approve or reject completed chores with optional feedback\n4. **Grant Reward** — Mark reward as given (or auto-grant on approval)\n5. **User Management** — Add family members (kids), assign roles\n\n#### For Kids:\n1. **View My Chores** — See assigned chores with details (what to do, reward, due date)\n2. **Mark Complete** — One-tap action to submit for parent review\n3. **Track Rewards** — See pending rewards, earned rewards history\n4. **Notifications** — Get alerts for new assignments, approaching deadlines\n\n#### Shared:\n1. **Simple Login** — Family code or shared account (no complex auth for MVP)\n2. **Activity Feed** — Timeline of assignments, completions, approvals\n3. **Dashboard** — Quick overview of active chores and recent activity\n\n### Feature Tagging\n\n| Feature | Tag | Rationale |\n|---------|-----|-----------|\n| Create chore (basic) | **MVP-LITE** | Core workflow requirement |\n| View chore board | **MVP-LITE** | Core workflow requirement |\n| Mark complete | **MVP-LITE** | Core workflow requirement |\n| Verify completion | **MVP-LITE** | Core workflow requirement |\n| Grant reward | **MVP-LITE** | Core workflow requirement |\n| User management (2 roles) | **MVP-LITE** | Core workflow requirement |\n| Activity feed | **MVP** | Valuable for communication/recognition |\n| Notifications | **MVP** | Reduces nagging, keeps workflow moving |\n| Track rewards history | **MVP** | Motivation and accountability |\n| Due dates | **MVP** | Structure and clarity |\n| Recurring chores | **POST-MVP** | Useful but not essential for first release |\n| Photos (before/after) | **POST-MVP** | Nice-to-have for verification |\n| Multiple reward types | **POST-MVP** | Start with points/money, expand later |\n| Allowance tracking | **POST-MVP** | Out of scope for simple tracker |\n| Calendar integration | **POST-MVP** | Feature creep risk |\n| Gamification (badges, levels) | **POST-MVP** | May feel childish for teen audience |\n| Smart home integration | **POST-MVP** | Cool but unnecessary complexity |\n\n### Feature Prioritization Rationale\n\n**MVP-LITE = Minimum Viable Product**\nThese features form the absolute core loop Maggie described: assign → complete → verify → reward. Without any one of these, the app doesn't fulfill its basic promise.\n\n**MVP = Enhanced Minimum Viable Product**\nThese features significantly improve UX and user retention without adding major complexity. Notifications prevent the \"I forgot\" problem. Activity feed provides the recognition Maggie wants. Reward history creates accountability.\n\n**POST-MVP = Future Enhancements**\nThese are \"nice to have\" but risk delaying launch or adding complexity that contradicts \"simple, fast, awesome.\" Better to ship clean MVP, gather feedback, then iterate.\n\n---\n\n## Skill 6: User Flows\n\n### Flow 1: Dad Assigns a Chore\n\n```\nSTART\n  ↓\nDad opens app → Dashboard\n  ↓\nTaps \"New Chore\" button\n  ↓\nEnters details:\n  - Chore name: \"Clean garage\"\n  - Description: \"Sweep floor, organize tools, take out trash\"\n  - Assign to: Maggie\n  - Reward: $15\n  - Due: Saturday 5pm (optional)\n  ↓\nTaps \"Assign\"\n  ↓\nChore appears on Maggie's \"My Chores\" list\n  ↓\nMaggie receives notification: \"New chore assigned: Clean garage - $15 reward\"\n  ↓\nEND\n```\n\n**Happy Path Success:** Chore created and communicated in under 30 seconds.\n\n**Alternate Paths:**\n- Dad saves as draft (assigns later)\n- Dad duplicates previous chore (recurring tasks)\n\n---\n\n### Flow 2: Maggie Completes and Reports Chore\n\n```\nSTART\n  ↓\nMaggie opens app → \"My Chores\" tab\n  ↓\nSees \"Clean garage\" chore card\n  - Shows: title, description, $15 reward, due Saturday 5pm\n  ↓\nMaggie does the chore (offline, real world)\n  ↓\nReturns to app, taps \"Clean garage\" card\n  ↓\nChore detail screen → Taps \"Mark Complete\" button\n  ↓\nOptional: Add note (\"Also washed the car!\")\n  ↓\nTaps \"Submit for Review\"\n  ↓\nChore moves to \"Awaiting Verification\" section\n  ↓\nDad receives notification: \"Maggie completed: Clean garage - Ready to verify\"\n  ↓\nEND\n```\n\n**Happy Path Success:** Reporting completion takes 3 taps + optional note.\n\n**Alternate Paths:**\n- Maggie marks \"In Progress\" first (shows Dad she's working on it)\n- Maggie adds photo proof (post-MVP feature)\n\n---\n\n### Flow 3: Dad Verifies and Grants Reward\n\n```\nSTART\n  ↓\nDad receives notification\n  ↓\nOpens app → \"Pending Verification\" section\n  ↓\nSees \"Clean garage\" awaiting review\n  ↓\nDad checks real-world work (walks to garage)\n  ↓\nReturns to app, taps chore card\n  ↓\nReviews Maggie's note\n  ↓\nDecision: Approve or Reject?\n  ↓\n  ├─ APPROVE:\n  │    ↓\n  │  Taps \"Approve & Reward\"\n  │    ↓\n  │  Chore marked complete, $15 added to Maggie's earned rewards\n  │    ↓\n  │  Maggie receives notification: \"Clean garage approved! You earned $15\"\n  │    ↓\n  │  Chore moves to \"Completed\" history\n  │    ↓\n  │  END (Happy path)\n  │\n  └─ REJECT:\n       ↓\n     Taps \"Request Changes\"\n       ↓\n     Adds feedback: \"Tools not organized, please finish\"\n       ↓\n     Chore returns to Maggie's active list with Dad's note\n       ↓\n     Maggie receives notification: \"Clean garage needs revision - see Dad's note\"\n       ↓\n     Maggie fixes issue, resubmits\n       ↓\n     Loop back to verification\n       ↓\n     END\n```\n\n**Happy Path Success:** Verification takes 2 taps if work is good.\n\n**Alternate Paths:**\n- Auto-approve after 24 hours (optional setting for trusted teens)\n- Dad marks \"Partially complete\" and adjusts reward ($10 instead of $15)\n\n---\n\n### Flow 4: Maggie Views Earned Rewards\n\n```\nSTART\n  ↓\nMaggie opens app → \"Rewards\" tab\n  ↓\nSees summary:\n  - Total earned this week: $35\n  - Total earned all time: $127\n  - Pending approval: $15 (garage chore)\n  ↓\nTaps \"History\" to see details\n  ↓\nScrolls through completed chores with dates and amounts\n  ↓\nTaps on specific chore to see details/notes\n  ↓\nEND\n```\n\n**Happy Path Success:** Clear visibility of effort → reward connection.\n\n**Alternate Paths:**\n- Export history as PDF (for tax purposes if kid runs a business, post-MVP)\n- Set savings goal (\"$200 for new bike\") with progress bar\n\n---\n\n## Skill 7: Information Architecture\n\n### Sitemap\n\n```\nChalley App\n│\n├── [AUTH] Family Login (simple code or email)\n│\n├── [PARENT VIEW]\n│   ├── Dashboard\n│   │   ├── Active chores (all users)\n│   │   ├── Pending verification\n│   │   ├── Quick stats (completed this week, total rewards paid)\n│   │   └── + New Chore button\n│   │\n│   ├── Create/Edit Chore\n│   │   ├── Form fields (name, description, assignee, reward, due date)\n│   │   └── Save/Assign button\n│   │\n│   ├── Verify Chore\n│   │   ├── Chore details\n│   │   ├── Kid's completion note\n│   │   └── Approve / Request Changes / Reject\n│   │\n│   ├── Family Management\n│   │   ├── Add/remove kids\n│   │   └── View user profiles\n│   │\n│   └── Settings\n│       ├── Notification preferences\n│       ├── Auto-approve rules\n│       └── Reward defaults\n│\n├── [KID VIEW]\n│   ├── My Chores\n│   │   ├── To Do (assigned chores)\n│   │   ├── In Progress (started but not submitted)\n│   │   ├── Awaiting Verification (submitted)\n│   │   └── Completed (approved history)\n│   │\n│   ├── Chore Detail\n│   │   ├── Description and requirements\n│   │   ├── Reward amount\n│   │   ├── Due date\n│   │   └── Mark Complete / Add Note\n│   │\n│   ├── My Rewards\n│   │   ├── Total earned (week, month, all-time)\n│   │   ├── Pending (awaiting approval)\n│   │   └── History (past rewards)\n│   │\n│   └── Activity Feed\n│       ├── New assignments\n│       ├── Approvals\n│       └── Parent comments\n│\n└── [SHARED]\n    ├── Notifications (push alerts)\n    ├── Help/Tutorial (first-time user flow)\n    └── Logout\n```\n\n### Screen Count Estimate\n\n**MVP-LITE:** 8-10 screens\n**MVP:** 12-15 screens\n**POST-MVP:** 20+ screens\n\n### Navigation Pattern\n\n**Bottom Tab Bar (Kid View):**\n- My Chores\n- Rewards\n- Activity\n\n**Bottom Tab Bar (Parent View):**\n- Dashboard\n- Verify\n- Family\n\n**Top Navigation:**\n- Settings (gear icon)\n- Notifications (bell icon)\n\n---\n\n## Skill 8: Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|------|----------|------------|------------|\n| **Real-time sync issues** — Parent and kid using different devices, data out of sync | HIGH | MEDIUM | Use proven backend (Firebase, Supabase) with built-in real-time sync. Test offline scenarios. |\n| **Authentication complexity** — Teens may not have email addresses, parents need security | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Start with simple family code system (like Jackbox games). Add proper auth post-MVP. |\n| **Platform fragmentation** — Need iOS + Android, budget may only support one | HIGH | LOW | Build as PWA (Progressive Web App) or use React Native for cross-platform. Start mobile-web, add native later. |\n| **Notification delivery** — Push alerts critical to workflow, but can be unreliable | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Implement in-app notifications as backup. Test notification permissions onboarding carefully. |\n| **Data privacy** — Storing family data (kids' info) raises COPPA/GDPR concerns | MEDIUM | LOW | Don't collect unnecessary data. Use age-appropriate privacy policy. Consider parent-owned account model. |\n\n### Adoption Risks\n\n| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|------|----------|------------|------------|\n| **Parent won't adopt** — If Dad doesn't use it, Maggie can't either | CRITICAL | MEDIUM | Make parent workflow extremely fast (< 30 sec to assign chore). Ensure notifications work reliably. |\n| **Competing with paper/texts** — Why use an app when sticky notes/texts work? | HIGH | MEDIUM | Emphasize unique value: reward tracking, history, no lost notes. Make onboarding show immediate value. |\n| **Feature confusion** — Too many options overwhelm first-time users | MEDIUM | HIGH | Ship MVP-LITE first. Add features via settings (opt-in). Strong onboarding tutorial. |\n| **Sibling fairness issues** — What if Maggie has siblings who feel left out or treated unfairly? | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Support multiple kids from day one. Transparent chore assignments (everyone sees who does what). |\n| **Reward disputes** — Arguments about whether work was \"good enough\" | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Encourage clear descriptions upfront. Feedback loop (request changes) instead of binary approve/reject. |\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|------|----------|------------|------------|\n| **Feature creep** — Client or users request calendars, allowance tracking, etc. | HIGH | HIGH | Define MVP-LITE boundaries clearly. Have \"roadmap\" for future features. Say \"yes, later\" not \"no.\" |\n| **Perfectionism** — \"Simple, fast, awesome\" → spending too long polishing UI | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Set sprint deadlines. Ship functional MVP even if not perfect. Iterate based on feedback. |\n| **Integration requests** — Users want Venmo, bank accounts, smart home, etc. | LOW | LOW | Park for post-MVP. Keep core simple. |\n\n### Business Risks\n\n| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|------|----------|------------|------------|\n| **Monetization unclear** — How does Challey make money? | MEDIUM | LOW | For Maggie's use case, this is less critical (personal project). If commercializing: freemium model (free for 1 family, $2.99/month unlimited) or one-time $9.99 purchase. |\n| **Competitive response** — Big players (Greenlight, S'moresUp) add \"simple mode\" | LOW | LOW | Speed to market. Focus on teen-first design (they can't pivot easily). Build community. |\n| **Maintenance burden** — App needs updates, bug fixes, server costs | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Use low-cost/free backend tier (Firebase free plan supports small user base). Open-source if community wants to help. |\n\n### Overall Risk Profile\n\n**Biggest Threats:**\n1. **Parent adoption** — If Dad doesn't commit to using the app, it fails immediately.\n2. **Feature creep** — Adding too much too soon contradicts \"simple, fast, awesome.\"\n3. **Technical sync issues** — Poor real-time updates create frustration and distrust.\n\n**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**\n- **Phase 1:** Build MVP-LITE with only 6 core features. Test with Maggie's family.\n- **Phase 2:** Gather feedback. Fix bugs. Add top-requested MVP feature.\n- **Phase 3:** Consider beta with 5-10 families. Iterate.\n- **Phase 4:** Public launch or keep private based on goals.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### What to Build First (MVP-LITE)\n\n**Week 1-2: Core Workflow**\n1. Simple login (family code)\n2. Create chore (parent)\n3. View chores (kid)\n4. Mark complete (kid)\n5. Verify/approve (parent)\n6. Basic reward tracking\n\n**Week 3: Polish**\n- Notifications (push or in-app)\n- Activity feed\n- Basic dashboard\n\n**Week 4: Testing**\n- Test with Maggie's family\n- Fix bugs\n- Gather feedback\n\n### What NOT to Build (Yet)\n\n- Allowance tracking (POST-MVP)\n- Recurring chores (POST-MVP)\n- Photos (POST-MVP)\n- Calendar integration (POST-MVP)\n- Banking/Venmo (POST-MVP)\n- Gamification (POST-MVP)\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n**For Maggie:**\n- Can report completed chores in < 5 taps\n- Sees rewards earned clearly\n- Feels recognized by parents\n\n**For Dad:**\n- Can assign chore in < 30 seconds\n- Gets notified when chores complete\n- Can verify quickly from phone\n\n**For Both:**\n- Fewer verbal reminders/arguments\n- Clear record of who did what\n- Family harmony improves\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n### Phase 1 Deliverables (Complete)\n- ✅ Discovery document (this file)\n- ✅ Summary report for PM\n- 🔜 Feedback Agent review with client (Maggie)\n- 🔜 Prototype design (UI/UX Designer)\n\n### Pending Questions for Client Review\n1. **Siblings:** Does Maggie have siblings who would also use this? (Affects user management scope)\n2. **Reward types:** Is money the only reward, or also privileges (screen time, outings, etc.)?\n3. **Verification strictness:** Should Dad be able to set \"auto-approve\" for certain chores Maggie does regularly?\n4. **Mobile vs. web:** Does Maggie primarily use a phone, tablet, or computer?\n5. **Parent count:** Just Dad assigns chores, or Mom too? (Affects user roles)\n\nThese questions will be addressed during Feedback Agent review.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Research Sources\n\n### Market Research\n- [Kids Chores Tracker (Google Play)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.neatkid.android&hl=en_US)\n- [Best Chore Apps for Families | Educational App Store](https://www.educationalappstore.com/app-lists/best-family-apps)\n- [Parenting Patch: Best Chore Apps](https://parentingpatch.com/best-chore-apps-for-kids-and-what-they-offer/)\n- [Homey App Official Site](https://www.homeyapp.net/)\n- [My First Nest Egg: Top 16 Allowance Apps](https://myfirstnestegg.com/articles/allowance-chores-app-for-kids/)\n\n### Competitive Analysis\n- [KiddiKash: Best Chore Apps 2025](https://www.kiddikash.com/blog/best-chore-apps-2025)\n- [Joon: 11 Best Chore Apps](https://www.joonapp.io/post/chore-app-for-kids)\n- [Common Sense Media: S'moresUp Review](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/smoresup-best-chores-app)\n- [FamiSafe: 8 Best Family Chore Apps 2026](https://famisafe.wondershare.com/app-review/family-chore-app.html)\n\n### User Research\n- [Orthodontics Limited: 10 Ways to Motivate Teens](https://www.orthodonticslimited.com/parenting/motivate-your-teens-to-love-chores/)\n- [Empowering Parents: How to Get Kids to Do Chores](https://www.empoweringparents.com/article/ill-do-it-later6-ways-to-get-kids-to-do-chores-now/)\n- [Parents App: Chores for Teenagers](https://parents.app/child-ages-stages/teenagers/chores-for-teenagers/a/)\n- [Greenlight: Chore List for Teens](https://greenlight.com/learning-center/home-and-chores/chore-list-for-teens)\n\n### Design Inspiration\n- [Bright Canary: 4 Best Apps for Teens](https://www.brightcanary.io/4-best-chore-and-allowance-apps-for-teens-and-tweens/)\n- [Levelty: Gamified Chore App](https://levelty.app/)\n- [BusyKid: Chore Charts](https://busykid.com/about-busykid/chore-charts/)\n\n---\n\n**Document Status:** FINAL\n**Ready for:** Feedback Agent Review (Mode 1)\n**Next Agent:** Feedback Agent → UI/UX Designer\n";
