Executive Summary\n\n**Drill or Drop** is an AI-powered well investment decision platform designed for non-operated working interest (NOWI) holders evaluating Authorization for Expenditure (AFE) proposals. The platform ingests AFE documents, validates land records against internal and third-party data, builds type curves from analog well performance data, auto-calculates full-cycle economics through an engine-driven model, and delivers a drill/drop recommendation through a comprehensive, interactive executive dashboard with live financial modeling, structured advisory voting, and a delegated approval chain with escalation.\n\nThe product addresses a fundamental challenge in upstream oil & gas: the AFE evaluation process for non-operators is manual, fragmented across spreadsheets and disconnected tools, and heavily dependent on institutional knowledge. Decisions that commit capital are often made without rigorous, repeatable analysis -- or the analysis takes so long that the election window closes before work is complete.\n\nDrill or Drop compresses this workflow from days or weeks into same-day automated results. It automates the mechanics (PDF parsing, land record matching, analog selection, economics calculations) while preserving expert control at every stage. Six roles define the workflow:\n\n| Role | Function |\n|------|----------|\n| **Administrator** | System configuration, user management, data source connections, DOI deck upload, approval chain setup, escalation rules |\n| **Land Analyst** | AFE ingestion (manual PDF upload or email auto-ingestion confirmation), DOI validation with confidence sign-off |\n| **Technical Analyst** | Analog well scouting, type curve construction, opex assumptions with confidence sign-off |\n| **Commercial Analyst** | Receives upstream inputs, validates engine-generated economics, applies deal structure assumptions, signs off with confidence |\n| **Commercial Advisory Group (CAG)** | Reviews comprehensive deal dashboard, adjusts inputs live, votes on each AFE (5-point scale with mandatory rationale) |\n| **Approver (CEO + Delegates)** | Sole approval authority: Drill / Drop / Send Back; delegated approval chain with time-based escalation |\n\nLand and Technical Analysts work **in parallel** after AFE ingestion, eliminating the sequential bottleneck of previous workflow designs. Once both sign off, the economics engine auto-calculates the full model. The Commercial Analyst validates and adjusts the auto-generated economics rather than building from scratch. The dashboard is a live financial model -- CAG members can change inputs and watch everything recalculate in real time before casting votes. The Approver sees the full picture: analyst confidence levels, CAG sentiment, and the complete financial analysis.\n\nIf the election deadline passes without an approval decision, the system flags the AFE as **Non-Consent** and records the outcome in the decision archive.\n\nThe platform targets a client managing non-operated interests across the Permian (Delaware and Midland sub-basins), Eagle Ford, Haynesville, and Powder River basins. The MVP handles one AFE at a time (multiple can exist but no side-by-side ranking). Well data is ingested from a multi-source strategy: free state regulatory data from Texas RRC, New Mexico OCD, and Wyoming WOGCC serve as the primary foundation, with Enverus CSV import as enrichment and fallback (especially for Louisiana/Haynesville data). API integration is a future upgrade path. The UI follows a light theme, modern, clean, professional design and is mobile-responsive from day one.\n\nThe v2.1 revision incorporates client decisions on 12 BA optimization recommendations: 8 approved for v1 (confidence auto-gating, deadline-aware prioritization, breakeven auto-calculation, asymmetric risk framing, stale evaluation detection, decision feedback loop data model, PDF template library, and export package), 1 approved for v2 (operator performance scorecards), 2 deferred, and 1 skipped. It also introduces a state regulatory data strategy that leverages free public well and production data as a primary data source, reducing dependency on Enverus CSV imports.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Problem Statement\n\n### The Non-Operator's Dilemma\n\nNon-operated working interest holders receive AFE proposals from operators and must make consequential capital allocation decisions -- often under tight election deadlines (typically 30 days, worst case 1 week) -- with limited access to the operator's subsurface data, completion design rationale, or economic assumptions. The typical evaluation process suffers from several structural weaknesses:\n\n**Fragmented Data and Tooling.** Land records live in Excel. Well data is pulled from Enverus manually via CSV exports. Economics are modeled in standalone spreadsheets. Commodity prices are looked up by hand. There is no single system that connects the evaluation pipeline end to end.\n\n**Manual, Error-Prone Workflows.** Division of Interest (DOI) validation requires cross-referencing internal records against operator statements and public data. Analog well selection is subjective and inconsistent. Type curve generation depends on who is doing the work and what wells they happen to choose. These manual steps introduce variability and risk.\n\n**Slow Turnaround.** A thorough AFE evaluation -- land validation, technical review, full economics, scenario analysis -- can take days to weeks depending on staff availability and the complexity of the prospect. When AFE election windows are tight, delays translate directly into missed opportunities or uninformed decisions.\n\n**No Institutional Memory.** Decisions are documented inconsistently. There is no structured archive of past evaluations, the assumptions that drove them, or how actual well performance compared to projections. The organization cannot learn from its own decision history.\n\n**Limited Scenario Flexibility.** Traditional spreadsheet models make it cumbersome to explore alternative structures -- farm-out percentages, financing terms, before/after payout splits, back-in provisions, sliding scale overrides, minimum royalties, promoted interest structures. Each scenario requires manual rework, discouraging thorough exploration of the decision space.\n\n**Expert Bottlenecks.** Senior technical and commercial staff are the scarce resource. They need tools that surface the analysis, not tools that require them to build the analysis from scratch every time.\n\n**No Structured Advisory Input.** Advisory group opinions are collected informally (email, hallway conversations, meetings) with no structured voting, no mandatory rationale capture, and no systematic way to aggregate sentiment for the decision-maker.\n\n**Approval Bottlenecks.** The CEO or primary decision-maker is frequently traveling or unavailable. There is no systematic delegation chain, no automated escalation, and no way to act on approvals via SMS when away from a desk. Missed deadlines result in non-consent elections with potential financial penalties.\n\n### The Opportunity\n\nAn integrated platform that automates the repeatable mechanics of AFE evaluation while preserving expert judgment at critical decision points would:\n\n- Reduce evaluation time from days to same-day automated results\n- Eliminate data transcription errors between systems\n- Standardize analog selection and type curve methodology\n- Enable rapid scenario exploration through a live interactive dashboard (with conversational AI in a future release)\n- Build an institutional decision archive that enables continuous improvement, seeded from historical spreadsheet data\n- Support complex deal structures including back-in after payout, sliding scale overrides, minimum royalties, and promoted interest provisions\n- Capture structured advisory votes with rationale for institutional memory\n- Ensure no election deadline is missed through automated escalation and delegation\n\n---\n\n## 3. Market Context\n\n### Industry Landscape\n\nThe upstream oil & gas software market is served by a handful of established platforms and a growing set of specialized analytics tools. The competitive landscape breaks down into several categories:\n\n#### Full-Stack E&P Analytics Platforms\n\n**Enverus (formerly DrillingInfo)** is the dominant data provider and increasingly a full-stack analytics platform. Enverus PRISM offers pre-generated and customizable forecasts and economics for over 5.4 million North American wells, with predictive forecasting, spacing analytics, and benchmarking workflows. Enverus positions itself as an all-in-one solution but is broadly focused on the entire E&P lifecycle -- not specifically on the non-operator AFE evaluation use case.\n\n**ComboCurve** provides forecasting, type curve analysis, economic scenario modeling, and decision support. Their platform can run up to 10 economic scenarios concurrently and integrates forecast-to-economics workflows. ComboCurve targets upstream and midstream companies, banks, advisors, and mineral/royalty owners.\n\n**Quorum Software (Val Nav)** is a long-standing reserves and economics platform used for asset evaluation, development planning, M&A analysis, and AFE economics. It is powerful but heavyweight -- designed for reserves engineers, not for rapid commercial decision-making.\n\n#### Specialized Analytics\n\n**Novi Labs** focuses on well-level data analytics, production forecasting, and investment screening. It provides proprietary research and analytics for rapid investment decisions and development planning. Novi explicitly positions against \"all-in-one solutions\" by emphasizing speed and accuracy over breadth.\n\n**TGS Well Data Analytics** integrates comprehensive well data, production data, completions data, geological attributes, and well economics in a cloud-based platform designed for faster decision-making.\n\n#### AFE Management Software\n\n**Pandell AFE** automates the AFE approval process with cost tracking, approval workflows, and reporting -- but focuses on the administrative lifecycle of the AFE document, not the underlying investment analysis.\n\n**Enertia Software** provides well production and AFE management with integrated workflows but is oriented toward operators, not non-operators.\n\n### Competitive Positioning for Drill or Drop\n\nNone of the existing platforms combine all of the following in a single workflow:\n\n1. Automated AFE PDF ingestion and field extraction (including email auto-ingestion)\n2. Land record validation with DOI cross-referencing against both internal records and Enverus\n3. AI-driven analog well selection and type curve generation\n4. Engine-driven full-cycle economic modeling (DCF, NPV, IRR, payout) with a flexible deal structure builder supporting back-in, sliding scale, promoted interest, and custom one-off structures\n5. A live interactive dashboard that serves as both a comprehensive deal summary and a real-time financial model\n6. Structured advisory voting with mandatory rationale on a 5-point scale\n7. Role-based expert review gates with confidence-level sign-offs\n8. Delegated approval chain with time-based escalation and SMS delegation\n9. Decision archiving with voting records, non-consent tracking, and future variance analysis capability\n\nThe existing tools are either too broad (Enverus, ComboCurve -- designed for operators doing full-field development planning), too narrow (Pandell -- AFE workflow only, no economics), or too technical (Val Nav -- designed for reserves engineers, steep learning curve). None offer the non-operator-specific workflow integration, the structured advisory voting model, the delegated approval chain, or the live interactive dashboard that Drill or Drop provides.\n\nDrill or Drop's differentiation lies in its focus on the non-operator's specific workflow, its end-to-end integration from AFE receipt to drill/drop decision, its AI-driven automation at every stage, its engine-driven economics, its structured governance model (confidence levels, voting, delegated approval), and its live interactive dashboard.\n\n### Market Timing\n\nThe oil & gas industry's adoption of AI and cloud-based analytics is accelerating. Companies are moving from legacy spreadsheet-based workflows to integrated platforms. Non-operators in particular are underserved by current tooling -- most platforms are designed for the operator's perspective. The market window for a purpose-built non-operator decision tool is open and growing.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Target Users & Personas\n\n### Persona 1: Administrator\n\n**Role:** System configuration, user management, data source connections, DOI deck maintenance, approval chain configuration, and escalation rules. The Administrator is the catch-all role for any system configuration activity.\n\n**Background:** Operations or IT staff responsible for maintaining the platform. Understands the company's organizational structure, data sources, and approval hierarchy. May also serve as Land or Commercial Analyst in smaller organizations.\n\n**Key Responsibilities:**\n- Configure and manage user accounts and role assignments\n- Set up and maintain data source connections (Enverus CSV import settings, pricing sources, opex API endpoints)\n- Upload and maintain the DOI deck (master land records from Excel)\n- Configure the delegated approval chain (Primary Approver, 1st Delegate, 2nd Delegate)\n- Set escalation rules and timing thresholds (X days before election deadline triggers escalation)\n- Manage notification preferences and escalation channels (in-app, email, SMS)\n- Configure system defaults (default discount rate, default price deck, basin settings)\n\n**Key Needs:**\n- Clean admin panel for user and role management\n- Intuitive data source configuration with validation feedback\n- DOI deck upload with change tracking and version history\n- Approval chain builder with drag-and-drop or simple assignment UI\n- Escalation rule configuration with preview/test capability\n- Audit log of all administrative changes\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- Currently no centralized system administration -- settings are scattered across spreadsheets, email rules, and tribal knowledge\n- Approval delegation is ad hoc (phone calls, forwarded emails)\n- No visibility into whether escalation is working or deadlines are at risk\n\n### Persona 2: Land Analyst\n\n**Role:** AFE ingestion and DOI validation. The Land Analyst either uploads AFE PDFs manually or confirms auto-ingested email AFEs. The system parses the AFE via a vision-language model and auto-validates against the DOI deck and Enverus data. The Land Analyst reviews matches, investigates discrepancies, can override values, and signs off with a confidence level.\n\n**Background:** Experienced landman or land analyst with deep knowledge of mineral ownership, title chains, and lease terms. Comfortable with Excel-based land records but would benefit from automated matching. Has access to Enverus CSV exports for cross-referencing.\n\n**Key Needs:**\n- Simple AFE upload (drag-and-drop PDF) or one-click confirmation of auto-ingested email AFEs\n- Automated extraction of key fields from AFE PDFs (API number, well name, legal description, stated interest, operator, costs)\n- Side-by-side comparison of AFE-stated interest vs. internal DOI deck vs. Enverus DOI data\n- Clear flagging of discrepancies with specific detail and severity\n- Ability to override system-matched values with explanation\n- Confidence level sign-off: High, Medium, or Low\n- Annotation capability for findings and adjustments\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- Currently cross-references AFEs against Excel spreadsheets manually\n- No systematic way to track which AFEs have been validated vs. pending\n- Discrepancies between operator-stated interest and internal records require manual investigation that is time-consuming and error-prone\n- No structured way to communicate confidence in the DOI validation to downstream consumers\n\n### Persona 3: Technical Analyst (Engineering + G&G)\n\n**Role:** Scouts Enverus for analog wells near the proposed location. Selects best-fit sample based on proximity, well type, operator, completion similarity, and historical production. Builds type curve (production profile). Provides opex assumptions based on operator history and well type. Signs off with confidence level.\n\n**Background:** Petroleum engineer or geoscientist with experience in decline curve analysis, completion design evaluation, and basin-level geology. Uses Enverus data (via CSV export) for well data. Understands type curve methodology including Arps decline models (exponential, hyperbolic, harmonic).\n\n**Key Needs:**\n- Automated analog well selection based on proximity, formation/bench, lateral length, completion design, operator track record, and well type\n- Transparent scoring algorithm for analog selection that can be reviewed and adjusted\n- Type curve generation from selected analogs with statistical confidence bounds (P10/P50/P90)\n- Ability to add/remove analogs and see the impact on the type curve in real time\n- Access to completion details, production histories, and directional surveys for selected analogs\n- Opex assumption entry based on operator history, well type, and basin benchmarks\n- Spud date determination from AFE or manual override\n- Confidence level sign-off: High, Medium, or Low\n- Ability to annotate technical assessment\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- Analog selection is currently subjective -- different analysts choose different wells and get different type curves\n- Building type curves manually in spreadsheets or standalone tools is time-consuming\n- No standardized methodology for analog scoring or weighting\n- Opex assumptions are disconnected from the technical evaluation and handed off informally\n\n### Persona 4: Commercial Analyst\n\n**Role:** Receives the type curve and opex assumptions from the Technical Analyst, the validated DOI from the Land Analyst, and capex from the AFE. Adds economic assumptions: price deck, trade terms/deal structures, discount rate. The economics engine auto-calculates the full model; the Commercial Analyst validates and adjusts the auto-generated economics rather than building from scratch. Produces output for the dashboard. Signs off with confidence level.\n\n**Background:** Financial analyst or commercial evaluator with experience in upstream oil & gas economics, deal structuring, and capital allocation. Understands DCF modeling, NPV/IRR analysis, and the nuances of non-operator deal economics (back-in provisions, promoted interest, sliding scale overrides).\n\n**Key Needs:**\n- Auto-assembled economic model from upstream inputs (type curve, DOI/NRI, capex, price deck, opex)\n- Ability to review and adjust all inputs and assumptions in the auto-generated model\n- Deal structure builder supporting standard WI/NRI, back-in after payout, sliding scale overrides, minimum royalties, promoted interest structures, and custom one-off deal terms\n- Configurable fixed price deck (user-defined flat pricing or escalation schedule)\n- Full cash flow analysis with all components: gross revenue, leasehold burdens (broken out), net revenue, fixed opex, variable opex, total opex, EBITDA, capex, free cash flow, cumulative cash flow\n- Key metrics: NPV (at configurable discount rates), IRR, payout period, ROI, Profitability Index\n- Sensitivity tables on price, production, and cost assumptions\n- Confidence level sign-off: High, Medium, or Low\n- Ability to annotate economic assessment\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- Currently builds economics in Excel, which is error-prone and not connected to the land or technical workstreams\n- Price deck updates are manual\n- No easy way to run multiple scenarios and compare side by side\n- Operating cost assumptions are hard to benchmark and often stale\n- Complex deal structures require bespoke spreadsheet formulas that are fragile and hard to audit\n\n### Persona 5: Commercial Advisory Group (CAG)\n\n**Role:** Reviews the comprehensive deal dashboard. Can change inputs (price, capex, opex, trade terms) and watch the dashboard recalculate live. Votes on each AFE using a 5-point scale: Drill / Lean Drill / Neutral / Lean Drop / Drop -- with mandatory rationale. Multiple users can be assigned this role.\n\n**Background:** Senior commercial, technical, or executive staff who serve as advisory members. May include VP-level managers, senior engineers, portfolio managers, or external advisors. They bring diverse expertise and perspectives to the evaluation.\n\n**Key Needs:**\n- Comprehensive deal dashboard showing the full analysis at a glance\n- Live interactive capability: change any input (price deck, capex, opex, trade terms) and see all charts, tables, and metrics recalculate in real time\n- Production profile chart, revenue waterfall, cash flow analysis (tabular and chart), economics summary\n- Analyst confidence indicators (High/Medium/Low from each analyst stage)\n- Clear recommendation with rationale that explains WHY the system recommends drill or drop\n- Predefined scenario controls (farm-out, price sensitivity, production case, deal structure)\n- 5-point voting interface: Drill / Lean Drill / Neutral / Lean Drop / Drop\n- Mandatory rationale field (at least one line per vote)\n- Visibility into other CAG members' votes and rationale (after voting or in real time, per configuration)\n- Voting summary showing sentiment distribution (\"4 of 6 advisors favor Drill\")\n- Mobile-responsive design for reviewing on phone or tablet\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- Currently receives analysis in disconnected formats (email, spreadsheets, slide decks)\n- Cannot easily explore alternative scenarios without asking an analyst to rebuild the model\n- Advisory input is informal and poorly documented -- no structured voting, no rationale capture\n- No way to see what other advisors think before the decision meeting\n- No mobile access to evaluations while traveling\n\n### Persona 6: Approver (CEO + Delegates)\n\n**Role:** Sole approval authority. Three actions: Approve (Drill) / Decline (Drop) / Send Back (routes to a specific analyst with questions). Delegated approval chain: Primary Approver, 1st Delegate, 2nd Delegate. Time-based escalation configurable by the Administrator. Can delegate via app or SMS.\n\n**Background:** CEO or senior executive with ultimate authority over capital allocation decisions. Frequently traveling. Needs maximum information density with minimum friction. Delegates may include COO, VP of Commercial, or other senior leaders empowered to act on behalf of the CEO.\n\n**Key Needs:**\n- Full deal dashboard with all analysis, analyst confidence levels, and CAG voting summary visible at a glance\n- Three clear action buttons: Approve (Drill) / Decline (Drop) / Send Back\n- Send Back capability that routes to a specific analyst with a written question or concern\n- Approval chain status: who is currently responsible, escalation timeline, deadline countdown\n- SMS delegation: \"Reply DELEGATE to pass to [Name]\" for quick handoff when away from desk\n- In-app, email, and SMS notifications with increasing urgency as deadline approaches\n- Mobile-optimized approval interface for quick action on phone\n- Override capability: can approve even when system or CAG recommends drop (with mandatory annotation)\n- Full decision archive visibility for pattern recognition across past decisions\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- Currently receives analysis only during scheduled meetings or via email\n- No way to act on approvals while traveling without calling the office\n- No systematic delegation when unavailable -- results in missed deadlines\n- Non-consent penalties from missed deadlines are a real financial risk\n- Cannot quickly see advisory group sentiment or analyst confidence to gauge how much review is needed\n\n---\n\n## 5. Workflow & Process\n\nThe Drill or Drop workflow is structured around a parallel processing model where Land and Technical Analysts work simultaneously after AFE ingestion, feeding into an engine-driven economics calculation that the Commercial Analyst validates. The CAG then reviews and votes on the comprehensive deal dashboard, and the Approver makes the final decision through a delegated approval chain with time-based escalation.\n\n### Workflow Diagram\n\n```\nAdmin configures system (one-time + ongoing maintenance)\n  |\n  v\nLand Analyst uploads AFE or confirms email auto-ingestion\n  |\n  v\nSystem parses AFE (vision-language model) + auto-validates against DOI deck and Enverus\n  |\n  +---------------------------+---------------------------+\n  |                           |                           |\n  v                           v                           |\n[Land Analyst validates DOI] [Technical Analyst builds    |\n Reviews matches,             type curve + opex]          |\n investigates discrepancies,  Selects analogs,            |\n overrides if needed,         builds production profile,  |\n signs off with confidence    provides opex assumptions,  |\n                              signs off with confidence    |\n  |                           |                           |\n  +---------------------------+                           |\n  |                                                       |\n  v                                                       |\nEconomics Engine auto-calculates full model                |\n(pulls: type curve from TA, DOI/NRI from Land,            |\n capex from AFE, price deck from settings,                |\n opex from TA/benchmarks)                                 |\n  |                                                       |\n  v                                                       |\nCommercial Analyst validates + adjusts auto-generated model\n Adds deal structure, trade terms, signs off with confidence\n  |\n  v\nComprehensive Deal Dashboard published with full analysis\n  |\n  v\nCAG members review dashboard, change inputs live,\n run scenarios, vote (Drill/Lean Drill/Neutral/Lean Drop/Drop)\n with mandatory rationale\n  |\n  v\nApprover reviews: full analysis + analyst confidence + CAG votes\n  |\n  +---> Approve (Drill) --> Decision archived\n  |\n  +---> Decline (Drop) --> Decision archived\n  |\n  +---> Send Back --> Routes to specific analyst with questions\n  |                   (analyst addresses, re-signs off, returns to CAG/Approver)\n  |\n  +---> No action --> Time-based escalation through delegate chain\n                      Primary Approver --> 1st Delegate --> 2nd Delegate\n                      (via in-app, email, SMS notifications)\n                      |\n                      +---> If deadline passes with no decision --> Non-Consent flag\n```\n\n**Key design change from v1.1:** Land and Technical Analysts work in **parallel** after AFE ingestion, not sequentially. This eliminates the sequential bottleneck and compresses the evaluation timeline.\n\n### Cross-Cutting Workflow Behaviors (New in v2.1)\n\n**Deadline-Aware Prioritization:** Every AFE carries its election deadline as a first-class data field. All workflow views -- analyst queues, CAG dashboard, Approver inbox -- are sorted by deadline urgency by default. Color-coded urgency indicators appear throughout the UI: green (>14 days), amber/yellow (7-14 days), red (<3 days). If an AFE is at risk of missing its deadline based on average processing time, the system proactively alerts all stakeholders.\n\n**Confidence Auto-Gating:** If any analyst (Land, Technical, or Commercial) signs off with **Low** confidence, the system auto-flags the evaluation to the Approver requiring explicit acknowledgment of the uncertainty before a final decision. This transforms confidence from a passive indicator into an active workflow gate. The Approver must annotate that they have reviewed and accepted the risk posed by the low-confidence sign-off.\n\n**Stale Evaluation Detection:** If any workflow stage has been in-progress for more than a configurable number of days without activity, the system flags it as \"stale.\" The Admin and assigned analyst are notified. If the evaluation is stale and the deadline is approaching, the system auto-escalates to the Admin with a recommendation to reassign. Stale evaluations are tracked as a metric visible in admin views.\n\n### Stage 1: AFE Ingestion & Land Validation (Land Analyst)\n\n**Trigger:** An AFE arrives via one of two paths:\n- **Email auto-ingestion:** An AI agent monitors the shared inbox, detects AFE documents, and queues them for the Land Analyst to confirm. The Land Analyst reviews the auto-detected AFE and clicks to confirm ingestion.\n- **Manual upload:** The Land Analyst uploads an AFE PDF directly via drag-and-drop.\n\nApproximately 50 operators send AFEs (3-5 AFEs/month), typically in PDF format.\n\n**Automated Steps:**\n1. The system parses the AFE PDF using a vision-language model to extract key fields:\n   - API number\n   - Well name\n   - Legal description / location (section, township, range)\n   - Proposed working interest / stated interest\n   - Operator name\n   - Proposed depth, formation, lateral length (if stated)\n   - Estimated total cost\n2. Extracted fields are auto-validated against the internal DOI deck (loaded from master Excel spreadsheet)\n3. The system confirms Division of Interest: does the stated interest match internal records?\n4. DOI is cross-referenced against Enverus records (imported via CSV) for independent validation\n5. Discrepancies are flagged with specific detail (e.g., \"AFE states 12.5% WI; internal records show 10.0% WI; Enverus shows 10.0% WI\")\n\n**Manual Review:**\n- Land Analyst reviews the automated matching results\n- Investigates any discrepancies (may require contact with the operator)\n- Can override system-matched values with explanation\n- Adds annotations explaining any adjustments\n- Signs off with confidence level: **High** (data is clean, strong match), **Medium** (some assumptions or minor discrepancies), or **Low** (significant gaps or unresolved issues)\n\n**Output:** Validated working interest, NRI, and leasehold burdens that feed into the economics engine.\n\n**Parallel Note:** This stage runs in parallel with Stage 2 (Technical Evaluation). Both must complete before economics are calculated.\n\n### Stage 2: Technical Evaluation (Technical Analyst) -- PARALLEL WITH STAGE 1\n\n**Trigger:** AFE ingestion (runs concurrently with Land Validation).\n\n**Automated Steps:**\n1. Using the well location and AFE details, the system searches pre-loaded Enverus CSV data to identify candidate analog wells\n2. Analog selection criteria include:\n   - **Proximity:** Wells within a configurable radius of the proposed location\n   - **Formation/Bench:** Same target formation and stratigraphic bench\n   - **Well type:** Matching well type (horizontal, vertical, directional)\n   - **Lateral length:** Similar to proposed (within configurable tolerance)\n   - **Completion design:** Similar proppant loading, stage count, fluid volume\n   - **Operator:** Same operator wells scored higher (configurable weighting)\n   - **Vintage:** Configurable recency weighting\n3. A smart scoring algorithm ranks candidate analogs by composite similarity\n4. Top-N analogs are selected (user-configurable N, default suggested)\n5. Production histories for selected analogs are retrieved from cached CSV data\n6. A type curve is generated:\n   - Normalize production histories to a common time-zero\n   - Apply Arps decline curve fitting (hyperbolic/harmonic/exponential) or modified hyperbolic (b-factor transition)\n   - Generate P10/P50/P90 probability bounds\n7. Spud date is extracted from AFE or set to a user-specified assumption\n8. Monthly production forecast is generated from spud date forward\n\n**Opex Assumptions (New in v2.0):**\n- Technical Analyst provides opex assumptions based on operator history, well type, and basin benchmarks\n- Fixed opex ($/well/month) and variable opex ($/BOE) inputs\n- These feed directly into the economics engine alongside public benchmark defaults\n\n**Manual Review:**\n- Technical Analyst reviews the analog selection and scoring\n- Can add/remove analogs and see real-time type curve updates\n- Reviews the decline model parameters (initial rate, b-factor, Di, terminal decline)\n- Reviews and adjusts opex assumptions\n- Adds annotations on technical risk factors, formation quality, offset well concerns\n- Signs off with confidence level: **High** (strong analogs, clean data), **Medium** (reasonable assumptions, some data gaps), or **Low** (limited data, weak analogs, high uncertainty)\n\n**Output:** Monthly oil and gas production forecast (P10/P50/P90) starting from projected spud date, plus opex assumptions.\n\n**Parallel Note:** This stage runs in parallel with Stage 1 (Land Validation). Both must complete before economics are calculated.\n\n### Stage 3: Economic Analysis (Engine-Driven + Commercial Analyst Validation)\n\n**Trigger:** Both Land Validation and Technical Evaluation sign-offs are complete.\n\n**Engine-Driven Auto-Calculation:**\n\nOnce Land and Technical provide outputs, the economics engine **auto-calculates** the full model by pulling inputs automatically:\n- Type curve (production forecast) from Technical Analyst\n- Validated DOI/NRI and leasehold burdens from Land Analyst\n- Capex from AFE\n- Price deck from system settings (Admin-configured defaults, adjustable by Commercial Analyst)\n- Opex from Technical Analyst assumptions and/or public benchmarks\n\nThe engine produces a complete first-pass economic model without any manual data entry.\n\n**Automated Calculation Steps:**\n1. **Production Forecast:** Monthly oil (bbl) and gas (Mcf) volumes from the type curve\n2. **Commodity Pricing:** User-configured fixed price deck (flat or escalation schedule) with optional basin-specific differentials\n3. **Gross Revenue:** Monthly production x applicable price\n4. **Net Revenue Interest (NRI):** Apply validated leasehold burdens\n   - NRI = WI x (1 - royalty burden - overriding royalties - other burdens)\n   - Net revenue = gross revenue x NRI\n5. **Deal Structure Application:** Apply the configured deal structure (standard WI/NRI, back-in after payout, sliding scale overrides, minimum royalty, promoted interest, or custom structure)\n6. **Operating Expenses:** Fixed opex + variable opex with escalation\n7. **EBITDA:** Net revenue - operating expenses\n8. **Capital Expenditures:** Gross capex from AFE; net capex adjusted for WI and any carry provisions\n9. **Free Cash Flow:** EBITDA - capex (applied in month 0 or spread per drilling schedule)\n10. **Cumulative Cash Flow:** Running total of free cash flow over time\n11. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):** Apply configurable discount rate (default 10%)\n12. **Key Metrics:** NPV, IRR, payout period, ROI, Profitability Index, undiscounted net cash flow\n\n**Commercial Analyst Role (Validate + Adjust):**\n- Reviews the auto-generated economic model\n- Adjusts price assumptions, opex, discount rate, deal structure parameters as needed\n- Configures deal structure via the deal structure builder:\n  - **Standard WI/NRI:** Fixed working interest and NRI throughout well life\n  - **Back-In After Payout:** WI increases after payout threshold\n  - **Sliding Scale Override:** Interest changes based on price, production, or date triggers\n  - **Minimum Royalty:** Floor royalty payment regardless of production\n  - **Promoted Interest:** Cost carry through a defined phase\n  - **Custom Structure:** Flexible rule builder for arbitrary splits, triggers, and overrides\n- Adds trade terms and any additional deal-specific economics\n- Reviews sensitivity to key variables\n- Adds annotations on economic risk factors and assumptions\n- Signs off with confidence level: **High** (solid economics, clean inputs), **Medium** (reasonable but some assumptions), or **Low** (high uncertainty, limited data)\n\n**Output:** Full economic model with key metrics, monthly cash flow schedule, and dashboard-ready data reflecting the configured deal structure.\n\n### Stage 4: CAG Review & Voting\n\n**Trigger:** Commercial Analyst sign-off publishes the comprehensive deal dashboard.\n\n**Dashboard (Live Interactive Financial Model):**\n\nThe dashboard is not a static report. It is a comprehensive deal dashboard AND live financial model with the following required components:\n\n- **Production Profile Chart:** Type curve with decline over time (oil + gas)\n- **Revenue Waterfall/Breakdown:** Gross revenue -> royalty burden -> ORRI -> other burdens -> net revenue\n- **Full Cash Flow Analysis** showing ALL components:\n  - Gross Revenue, Leasehold Burdens (broken out), Net Revenue, Fixed Opex, Variable Opex, Total Opex, EBITDA, Capex, Free Cash Flow, Cumulative Cash Flow\n  - Available in **both tabular AND chart formats**\n- **Economics Summary:** NPV, IRR, Payout, ROI, PI with detail\n- **Recommendation with Rationale:** Not just a banner -- explains WHY the system recommends drill or drop based on the specific economics and risk factors\n- **Analyst Confidence Indicators:** High/Medium/Low from each analyst (Land, Technical, Commercial)\n- **Voting Summary:** CAG sentiment distribution and individual votes with rationale\n- **Approval Chain Status:** Who is next to approve, escalation timeline, deadline countdown\n\n**Live Interactive Capability:**\n- CAG members can change inputs directly: capex, price deck, opex, trade terms/deal structure\n- Everything recalculates in real time -- charts, tables, metrics, recommendation\n- Recommendation can flip (DRILL to DROP or vice versa) based on changed inputs\n- Predefined scenario controls (farm-out, price sensitivity, production case, deal structure) are integrated into the live model\n\n**Voting Model:**\n- 5-point scale: **Drill / Lean Drill / Neutral / Lean Drop / Drop**\n- Mandatory rationale: at least one line explaining the vote\n- Dashboard shows sentiment summary (e.g., \"4 of 6 advisors favor Drill\")\n- All votes and rationale are visible to the Approver\n- Multiple CAG members can be assigned; all vote independently\n\n### Stage 5: Approval & Escalation\n\n**Trigger:** CAG voting complete (or Approver can act before all CAG votes are in).\n\n**Approval Actions:**\n- **Approve (Drill):** Accept the AFE and commit capital. Decision archived with full context.\n- **Decline (Drop):** Reject the AFE. Decision archived with full context.\n- **Send Back:** Route the evaluation back to a specific analyst with written questions or concerns. The analyst addresses the issues, re-signs off, and the evaluation returns to the CAG/Approver stage.\n\n**Delegated Approval Chain:**\n- Admin configures: Primary Approver -> 1st Delegate -> 2nd Delegate\n- Escalation threshold: configurable number of days before the election deadline\n- When the threshold is reached without action from the current approver, the system auto-escalates to the next person in the chain\n- Notifications increase in urgency as the deadline approaches:\n  - **In-app:** All workflow events\n  - **Email:** Sign-off requests, escalations, approaching deadlines\n  - **SMS:** Urgent escalations and quick delegation\n- Any person in the chain can manually delegate at any time via app or SMS (\"Reply DELEGATE to pass to [Name]\")\n- If nobody acts before the election deadline: system flags as **Non-Consent**\n\n**Non-Consent Handling:**\n- Non-consent penalties are captured in the land records / DOI deck\n- The system records the non-consent outcome in the decision archive\n- The app is decision support and tracking -- it does not execute real-world actions (operator communications, election filings happen outside the app for now)\n- **Future v2:** Connect agreements to assets to surface penalty implications automatically when a non-consent flag is triggered\n\n---\n\n## 6. Data Architecture (High Level)\n\n### Data Sources\n\n| Source | Data | Format | Access Method | Refresh | Role |\n|--------|------|--------|---------------|---------|------|\n| AFE Documents | Well proposals | PDF | Email auto-ingestion + manual upload | Event-driven | Primary |\n| Internal DOI Deck | DOI, WI, burdens, lease info, non-consent penalties | Excel (.xlsx) | Single master spreadsheet loaded into app database | Manual upload by Admin | Primary |\n| TX RRC (Railroad Commission) | Well data, production (monthly), drilling permits, completions, field data, digital maps | CSV/ASCII/Shapefiles | Free bulk file downloads from RRC website | Weekly to monthly | Primary (TX) |\n| NM OCD (Oil Conservation Division) | Wells, production statistics, well injection totals | JSON/CSV/GeoJSON | Free REST API (ArcGIS-based) via OCD Hub | Near real-time | Primary (NM) |\n| WY WOGCC (Oil & Gas Conservation Commission) | Well info, location, status, API numbers, permits, production | CSV/GeoJSON/JSON | Free REST API via Data Explorer | Configurable | Primary (WY) |\n| Enverus | Well headers, production, completions, DOI, surveys | CSV | CSV import from Enverus data exports | Manual upload / batch import | Enrichment / Fallback |\n| Fixed Price Deck | WTI, Henry Hub prices | User config | Admin-configurable in application | Manual update | Primary |\n| Public Opex Benchmarks | LOE per BOE by basin, operator | Curated dataset | Manual curation from public filings, 10-Ks | Quarterly/Annual | Primary |\n| Opex (TA Input) | Fixed and variable opex assumptions | User input | Technical Analyst provides per evaluation | Per AFE | Primary |\n\n**Data Source Strategy (v2.1):** Free state regulatory data serves as the primary foundation for well and production data across the target basins. Enverus CSV imports provide enrichment (completions detail, DOI cross-referencing, directional surveys) and serve as the primary fallback for Louisiana/Haynesville data where no reliable public API exists. A unified data normalization layer ingests from all sources into a common internal schema.\n\n### Data Flow (Parallel Model)\n\n```\nAFE (Email or Manual Upload)\n         |\n         v\n[Vision-Language Model Parser] --> AFE Data Store\n         |\n         +--------------------------------------------+\n         |                                            |\n         v                                            v\n[Land Validation Engine]                    [Analog Selection Engine]\n Internal DOI Deck (Excel) ---->             Enverus CSV Data ---->\n Enverus CSV (DOI cross-ref) -->             (well search, scoring)\n         |                                            |\n         v                                            v\n Validated DOI/NRI/Burdens              [Type Curve Engine] --> Production Forecast\n (Land Analyst sign-off                  Opex Assumptions\n  with confidence level)                 (Technical Analyst sign-off\n         |                                with confidence level)\n         |                                            |\n         +--------------------+-----------------------+\n                              |\n                              v\n                    [Economics Engine]  <-- Price Deck (Settings)\n                    (Auto-calculates)  <-- Capex (from AFE)\n                              |\n                              v\n                    Auto-Generated Economic Model\n                    (Commercial Analyst validates/adjusts,\n                     signs off with confidence level)\n                              |\n                              v\n                   Comprehensive Deal Dashboard\n                   (Live Interactive Financial Model)\n                              |\n                              v\n                    CAG Review + Live Scenarios\n                    (5-Point Voting with Rationale)\n                              |\n                              v\n                    Approver Decision\n                    (Drill / Drop / Send Back)\n                    Delegated Chain + Escalation\n                              |\n                              v\n                    Decision Archive\n                    (includes votes, confidence, non-consent tracking)\n```\n\n### State Regulatory Data Strategy (New in v2.1)\n\nThe client's target basins span four states. Each state's oil and gas regulatory body publishes well and production data, but availability and access methods vary significantly:\n\n**Texas (RRC -- Railroad Commission of Texas):**\n- No API, but free bulk file downloads available at https://www.rrc.texas.gov/resource-center/research/data-sets-available-for-download/\n- Datasets: Production data (monthly, CSV/ASCII), well data (weekly, ASCII), drilling permits, completion data, field data, digital map data (shapefiles)\n- Update frequency: Monthly to weekly depending on dataset\n- Coverage: Permian Basin (Midland sub-basin in West TX), Eagle Ford (South TX), and the Texas portion of the Haynesville\n- Implementation: Scheduled bulk download, parse ASCII/CSV into normalized schema, incremental updates via date-filtered downloads\n\n**New Mexico (OCD -- Oil Conservation Division):**\n- Free REST API via OCD Hub (ArcGIS-based) at https://api.emnrd.nm.gov/\n- Datasets: Oil and gas wells, production statistics (OG Statistics), well injection totals\n- Formats: JSON, CSV, GeoJSON\n- Additional resources: OCD Well Search tool (completions, formation tops, casing, perfs, production), NM Tech Octane Database (monthly production data)\n- Coverage: Permian Basin (Delaware sub-basin in SE NM)\n- Implementation: Direct API integration with pagination, scheduled sync\n\n**Wyoming (WOGCC -- Oil & Gas Conservation Commission):**\n- Free REST API via Data Explorer\n- Datasets: Well info, location, status, API numbers, permits, production data\n- Formats: CSV, GeoJSON, JSON\n- Additional resources: Wyoming Geospatial Hub (full state or user-defined area downloads)\n- Coverage: Powder River Basin\n- Implementation: Direct API integration, scheduled sync with incremental updates\n\n**Louisiana (SONRIS -- Strategic Online Natural Resources Information System):**\n- No clear public API for programmatic access\n- Web-based Interactive Data Reports available (free) but not API-accessible\n- ArcGIS MapServer exists but SSL certificate is expired and reliability is unclear\n- DODA export tool appears to be internal/government-only\n- Coverage: Haynesville (Louisiana side)\n- Implementation: **Enverus CSV import is the primary data path for Louisiana.** Alternative: contact LA DNR directly about bulk data access for future improvement\n\n**Data Ingestion Strategy:**\n- **Primary (free):** TX RRC bulk downloads, NM OCD API, WY WOGCC API\n- **Fallback/enrichment:** Enverus CSV imports for Louisiana and any data gaps across all states\n- **Future upgrade:** Enverus Developer API v3 when/if subscription includes it\n- **Architecture:** A unified data normalization layer ingests from all state formats and Enverus into a common internal schema. All downstream components (analog selection, type curve, DOI cross-reference) query the normalized layer and are agnostic to the original data source.\n\n### Data Model Provisions for Future Features (New in v2.1)\n\nThe following data model structures are included in v1 to support planned v2 features, even though the corresponding UI or analytics are deferred:\n\n**Operator Performance Scorecard Data Model (supports v2 Operator Scorecards):**\n- Operator entity with performance tracking fields: average EUR, IP-30, IP-90, completion design consistency metrics, historical DOI accuracy rate, AFE decision history\n- Relationships: Operator -> Wells (from state data + Enverus), Operator -> AFE Evaluations (from decision archive)\n- Data accumulates automatically as evaluations are processed; v2 UI will surface it as scorecards\n\n**Decision Outcome Feedback Loop Data Model (supports v2 Variance Analysis):**\n- For every \"Drill\" decision, the system creates a pending \"Outcome Record\" expecting future production data\n- Import mechanism for actual production data (same state data + Enverus CSV paths)\n- Auto-match to historical decisions by API number\n- Status tag on archived decisions: \"Awaiting Production Data\" / \"Production Data Available\" / \"Not Applicable (Dropped)\"\n- No variance analysis UI in v1 -- data collection only to eliminate the cold-start problem for v2\n\n### Storage Considerations\n\n- **AFE Documents:** Store original PDFs and parsed/extracted data. Maintain version history if re-parsed.\n- **DOI Deck:** Structured database loaded from a single master Excel spreadsheet. Support incremental updates. Track change history. Include non-consent penalty data.\n- **Well Data Cache:** Store Enverus CSV data in the application database. Refresh when new CSV exports are uploaded. Future: API integration for on-demand refresh.\n- **Economic Models:** Store all inputs and outputs for every evaluation, including deal structure configuration. Immutable once signed off. Track auto-generated vs. analyst-adjusted versions.\n- **Votes:** Store all CAG votes with rationale, timestamp, and user identity. Immutable once cast.\n- **Decisions:** Full audit trail -- who decided, when, with what recommendation, all analyst confidence levels, all CAG votes, any Send Back history, any override, annotations.\n- **Scenarios:** Store user-created scenarios for retrieval and comparison.\n- **Historical Decisions:** Import path for historical evaluations from spreadsheets to seed the decision archive.\n- **Notification Log:** Record all notifications sent (in-app, email, SMS) for audit and troubleshooting.\n\n---\n\n## 7.

AI & Automation Capabilities\n\nAI and automation are embedded throughout the Drill or Drop workflow. The system is designed to automate the repeatable, data-intensive mechanics while preserving human expert judgment at critical decision points. The v2.0 architecture emphasizes engine-driven economics and parallel processing.\n\n### AFE Ingestion & Parsing\n\n**AI Capability:** Document intelligence / structured extraction + email monitoring\n\n- **Email Auto-Ingestion Agent:** Monitors the shared inbox for incoming AFE documents. Uses classification to identify AFE-related emails and attachments. Queues detected AFEs for Land Analyst confirmation.\n- **PDF Parsing:** Vision-language model (e.g., GPT-4 Vision, Claude) interprets the AFE document and extracts structured fields based on a prompt template. Handles layout variability across ~50 operator formats without training custom models.\n- **Field Matching:** Fuzzy matching algorithms to match extracted well names, API numbers, and legal descriptions against the DOI deck. Handle common variations (abbreviations, formatting differences, typos).\n- **Auto-Validation:** Automated comparison logic flags mismatches between AFE-stated interest, DOI deck, and Enverus data. Categorize discrepancies by severity.\n\n### Parallel Analyst Workstreams\n\n**AI Capability:** Intelligent search, similarity scoring, statistical modeling\n\n- **Analog Scoring Engine:** Multi-dimensional similarity scoring that weights proximity, formation match, well type, lateral length, completion design, operator, and vintage. Transparent and tunable scoring.\n- **Smart Filtering:** Exclude wells with anomalous production profiles (mechanical failures, curtailments, data quality issues).\n- **Type Curve Generation:** Automated decline curve fitting using Arps models with best-fit parameter selection. P10/P50/P90 from the analog set.\n- **Adaptive Learning (Future):** As the system accumulates decision history and post-drill performance data, analog scoring weights can be refined.\n\n### PDF Template Library (New in v2.1)\n\n**AI Capability:** Adaptive extraction with template caching\n\n- **Template Learning:** After the Land Analyst confirms a successful parse, the system stores the extraction mapping as a \"template\" for that operator.\n- **Template-First Extraction:** For future AFEs from the same operator, the system first attempts template-based extraction (fast, cheap, deterministic).\n- **Vision-Language Model Fallback:** Falls back to the full vision-language model only for new operators or template mismatches.\n- **Cost Reduction:** Over time, the template library covers most incoming AFEs (~50 operators), reducing AI API costs per AFE and improving processing speed.\n- **Template Maintenance:** Templates are versioned. If an operator changes their AFE format, the mismatch is detected and the vision-language model re-processes, generating an updated template.\n\n### Engine-Driven Economics\n\n**AI Capability:** Automated model assembly, calculation engine, deal structure modeling\n\n- **Auto-Calculation:** The economics engine assembles the complete model automatically from upstream inputs once Land and Technical sign off. No manual data entry required for the first pass.\n- **Input Sourcing:** Type curve from Technical Analyst, DOI/NRI from Land Analyst, capex from AFE, price deck from system settings, opex from Technical Analyst/benchmarks -- all pulled automatically.\n- **Deal Structure Engine:** Applies complex deal structures including back-in provisions, sliding scale overrides, minimum royalties, promoted interest calculations, and custom user-defined structures.\n- **Sensitivity Engine:** Automated sensitivity analysis across key variables with tornado chart generation.\n- **Breakeven Auto-Calculation (New in v2.1):** Automatically computes breakeven oil price, gas price, capex, opex, and minimum working interest for every deal (the value at which NPV = 0). Breakeven metrics are displayed on the dashboard alongside the economics summary. The recommendation rationale references breakeven margins (e.g., \"Current oil price of $70/bbl is $18/bbl above the breakeven price of $52/bbl, providing a 35% margin of safety\").\n- **Commercial Analyst as Validator:** The Commercial Analyst's role shifts from building the model to validating and adjusting the auto-generated model, significantly reducing turnaround time and error potential.\n\n### Live Interactive Dashboard\n\n**Capability:** Real-time parameterized recalculation\n\n- **Live Recalculation:** When any user (CAG or Approver) changes an input on the dashboard, the entire model recalculates instantly -- charts, tables, metrics, and recommendation all update.\n- **Recommendation Engine:** Synthesizes land validation confidence, technical risk assessment, economic returns, and analyst confidence levels into a composite drill/drop recommendation with explanatory rationale.\n- **Scenario Controls:** Integrated sliders, toggles, and inputs for farm-out %, price sensitivity, production case, deal structure, opex, and financing terms.\n- **Scenario Comparison:** Users can save named scenarios for side-by-side comparison.\n\n### Notification & Escalation Engine\n\n**Capability:** Multi-channel notification with urgency escalation\n\n- **Workflow Notifications:** In-app notifications triggered by all workflow state changes (AFE ingested, sign-off complete, vote cast, decision made).\n- **Escalation Notifications:** Email and SMS notifications triggered by approaching deadlines and approval chain escalation.\n- **Urgency Gradient:** Notification frequency and channel intensity increase as the election deadline approaches.\n- **SMS Delegation:** Quick-response SMS capability for delegation without opening the app.\n\n### Cross-Cutting AI\n\n- **Inbox Monitoring Agent:** Watches the shared inbox for incoming AFE documents and auto-triggers the ingestion pipeline.\n- **Confidence Aggregation:** Synthesizes individual analyst confidence levels into an overall assessment displayed prominently on the dashboard.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Scenario Modeling & Live Dashboard\n\nScenario modeling in v2.0 is no longer a separate stage -- it is embedded directly into the comprehensive deal dashboard as a live interactive capability. CAG members and the Approver interact with the same live financial model.\n\n### Live Interactive Dashboard (Primary Interface)\n\nThe dashboard serves dual purposes: it is the comprehensive deal summary AND the live scenario modeling tool. When any input changes, everything recalculates:\n\n| Input | Control Type | Range | What Recalculates |\n|-------|-------------|-------|-------------------|\n| Farm-Out | Slider | 0-100% | WI, capex share, revenue share, all economics |\n| Oil Price | Slider / Input | +/- 50% from base | Revenue, cash flow, NPV, IRR, payout, recommendation |\n| Gas Price | Slider / Input | +/- 50% from base | Revenue, cash flow, NPV, IRR, payout, recommendation |\n| Production Case | Toggle | P10 / P50 / P90 | Production forecast, revenue, all economics |\n| Discount Rate | Input | 0-25% | NPV, PI |\n| Opex (Fixed) | Input | $/well/month | Cash flow, EBITDA, NPV, IRR, payout |\n| Opex (Variable) | Input | $/BOE | Cash flow, EBITDA, NPV, IRR, payout |\n| Capex | Input | $ | Cash flow, NPV, IRR, payout, ROI |\n| Deal Structure | Dropdown + Config | Presets + Custom | NRI schedule, cash flow splits, all economics |\n| Before/After Payout | Toggle + Config | On/Off + Split % | WI schedule, cash flow splits, all economics |\n| Financing Terms | Input | Custom | Net capex, cash flow, all return metrics |\n\n**Dashboard Components (all update live):**\n\n1. **Production Profile Chart** -- Type curve showing oil and gas production decline over time\n2. **Revenue Waterfall** -- Visual breakdown: gross revenue -> royalty burden -> ORRI -> other burdens -> net revenue\n3. **Cash Flow Table** -- Monthly/annual with columns for: Gross Revenue, each Leasehold Burden, Net Revenue, Fixed Opex, Variable Opex, Total Opex, EBITDA, Capex, Free Cash Flow, Cumulative Cash Flow\n4. **Cash Flow Chart** -- Visual representation of the cash flow table (stacked bar or area chart)\n5. **Economics Summary Panel** -- NPV, IRR, Payout (months), ROI, PI -- prominently displayed\n6. **Recommendation Banner with Rationale** -- DRILL or DROP with a paragraph explaining WHY based on the current inputs\n7. **Analyst Confidence Indicators** -- Three badges showing High/Medium/Low from Land, Technical, and Commercial Analysts\n8. **CAG Voting Summary** -- Sentiment distribution chart + individual votes with rationale\n9. **Approval Chain Status** -- Current approver, escalation timeline, deadline countdown\n\n### Breakeven Sensitivity Display (New in v2.1)\n\nThe dashboard prominently displays auto-calculated breakeven points alongside the economics summary:\n\n| Breakeven Metric | Description | Display |\n|-----------------|-------------|---------|\n| Breakeven Oil Price | WTI price at which NPV = 0 | $/bbl with margin vs. current price |\n| Breakeven Gas Price | HH price at which NPV = 0 | $/Mcf with margin vs. current price |\n| Breakeven Capex | Maximum capex at which well still works | $ with margin vs. AFE capex |\n| Breakeven Opex | Maximum opex at which well still works | $/BOE with margin vs. assumed opex |\n| Breakeven WI | Minimum working interest worth participating | % with margin vs. stated WI |\n\nThese breakeven values update live when any dashboard input changes.\n\n### Asymmetric Risk Framing (New in v2.1)\n\nThe recommendation section of the dashboard includes an asymmetric risk analysis panel:\n\n- **Upside case (P10):** NPV, IRR, and payout if the well outperforms\n- **Base case (P50):** Expected scenario economics\n- **Downside case (P90):** NPV, IRR, and payout if the well underperforms\n- **Maximum loss:** Capex exposure if the well is a total dry hole\n- **Regret analysis:** Presented as a 2x2 decision matrix:\n\n| | Well Performs (P10-P50) | Well Underperforms (P90) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Drill** | Upside captured (NPV at P10) | Downside realized (NPV at P90) |\n| **Drop** | Opportunity cost forfeited | Loss avoided |\n\nThis framing shifts the decision from \"is this a good well?\" to \"is the risk-reward profile acceptable given our portfolio and capital position?\" -- how sophisticated capital allocators actually think. The regret analysis values update live with all other dashboard components.\n\n**Scenario Comparison:**\n- Users can save the current state as a named scenario\n- Side-by-side comparison view shows key metrics across saved scenarios\n- Scenario history is stored as part of the evaluation record\n\n### Future: Conversational AI Scenarios (v2+)\n\nA conversational AI interface is planned for a post-MVP release. This will accept natural language requests and dynamically execute them:\n\n**Example interactions (planned for v2):**\n\n> **User:** \"What happens if we farm out 50% and oil drops to $55?\"\n> **System:** Adjusts the live model to 50% farm-out and $55/bbl WTI. Dashboard recalculates instantly.\n\n> **User:** \"What price does oil need to be for this well to break even?\"\n> **System:** Runs a goal-seek analysis to find the oil price at which NPV = 0.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Decision Archive & Analytics\n\n### Decision Archive\n\nEvery AFE evaluation produces a decision record that is stored immutably in the system:\n\n**Record Contents:**\n- AFE identifier (API number, well name, operator)\n- Evaluation date range (received to decision)\n- Land validation results, confidence level, and sign-off timestamp\n- Analog wells selected, type curve parameters, opex assumptions, technical confidence level, and sign-off timestamp\n- Economic model inputs and outputs (including deal structure configuration), commercial confidence level, and sign-off timestamp\n- Auto-generated economic model (before Commercial Analyst adjustments) -- preserved for audit\n- System-generated recommendation (drill/drop with rationale)\n- Expert-validated recommendation (after all sign-offs)\n- **CAG votes:** Each member's vote (5-point scale), rationale, and timestamp\n- **CAG sentiment summary:** Aggregated vote distribution\n- Final decision: Approve (Drill) / Decline (Drop) / Non-Consent\n- Send Back history: any questions sent to analysts, responses, and re-sign-off records\n- Override annotation (if Approver overrode recommendation)\n- Approval chain activity: who was notified, who escalated, who acted, delegation history\n- All scenarios explored during the evaluation\n- **Non-consent record:** If deadline passed without decision, record the non-consent flag, associated penalties from DOI deck, and contributing factors (e.g., approval chain exhausted, no CAG votes, etc.)\n\n**Search & Filter:**\n- By operator, basin, formation, date range, decision outcome\n- By economic metrics (e.g., \"show all wells where NPV > $1M\")\n- By override status (e.g., \"show all overrides\")\n- By analyst confidence level (e.g., \"show all evaluations where any analyst flagged Low confidence\")\n- By CAG sentiment (e.g., \"show all evaluations where majority voted Lean Drop or Drop\")\n- By non-consent status\n- By approval chain activity (e.g., \"show all evaluations that escalated to 2nd Delegate\")\n\n### Historical Decision Data Import\n\nThe system provides a spreadsheet import path for seeding the decision archive with historical AFE evaluations. This allows the organization to build institutional memory from day one, even for decisions made before Drill or Drop was deployed.\n\n**Import Capabilities:**\n- Upload historical evaluation spreadsheets (Excel format)\n- Configurable column mapping to map spreadsheet fields to the decision archive schema\n- Support for partial records (not all fields may be available for historical decisions)\n- Validation and error reporting for imported records\n- Historical records are clearly tagged as \"imported\" vs. \"native\" in the archive\n\n### Future: Post-Drill Variance Analysis (v2)\n\nOnce a well is drilled and production data becomes available, the system can compare:\n\n- **Projected vs. Actual Production:** How did the type curve compare to actual production? Was the well a P10, P50, or P90 outcome?\n- **Projected vs. Actual Economics:** Given actual production and realized prices, how did actual returns compare to projections?\n- **Systematic Bias Detection:** Across multiple wells, are projections consistently optimistic or pessimistic? By basin? By operator? By formation?\n- **Analog Quality Analysis:** Which analog wells most accurately predicted the outcome? Can analog selection weights be improved?\n- **Confidence Calibration:** Are analysts who sign off with \"High\" confidence actually more accurate than \"Medium\" or \"Low\"? Calibrate confidence levels against outcomes.\n- **CAG Vote Accuracy:** Which advisory members' votes most accurately predicted well outcomes? Surface patterns in advisory quality.\n\n### Future: Portfolio Comparison & Capital Allocation (v2)\n\n- **Portfolio Ranking:** Rank all active AFEs by risk-adjusted return metrics\n- **Capital Allocation:** Given a capital budget, which combination of AFEs maximizes portfolio NPV?\n- **Diversification Analysis:** Portfolio exposure by basin, operator, formation -- avoid concentration risk\n- **Timeline View:** Expected cash flow timing across the portfolio for liquidity planning\n\n---\n\n## 11. Technical Considerations\n\n### 11.1 Enverus Integration\n\n**Enrichment & Fallback Data Path: CSV Import**\n\nWith state regulatory data as the primary foundation (see 11.2), Enverus CSV import serves as enrichment for data not available from state sources (completions detail, DOI cross-referencing, directional surveys) and as the primary data path for Louisiana/Haynesville. The import system handles:\n\n- **Column Mapping:** Configurable mapping from Enverus CSV column headers to the internal data schema. Supports multiple export formats as Enverus export layouts may vary.\n- **Data Validation:** On import, the system validates required fields, data types, and referential integrity. Invalid rows are flagged for review.\n- **Incremental Import:** Support for incremental data loads -- new wells and updated production data are merged with existing records. Duplicate detection by API number.\n- **Batch Import:** Support for bulk initial load as well as periodic refresh uploads.\n\n**Key Datasets (via CSV):**\n- Well headers (location, operator, status, formation)\n- Monthly/daily production (oil, gas, water)\n- Completion details (lateral length, proppant, stages, fluid)\n- Division of Interest / leasehold data\n- Directional surveys\n\n**Future Upgrade Path: Enverus Developer API**\n\nThe Enverus Developer API v3 provides real-time access to the same datasets via the `enverus-developer-api` Python client library. API integration is planned as a post-MVP upgrade that would supplement both state data and CSV imports by enabling:\n- On-demand analog well search without pre-loading data\n- Real-time production data refresh\n- Automated data synchronization on a configurable schedule\n\n**Considerations for API Upgrade:**\n- **Subscription Verification Required:** The client's Enverus subscription level must support Developer API (Direct Access), which may require an add-on.\n- **Rate Limiting:** The API has rate limits. The application must handle rate limiting with exponential backoff.\n- **Cost:** Enverus API access may carry additional costs beyond the base subscription.\n\n### 11.2 State Regulatory Data Integration (New in v2.1)\n\nFree state regulatory data serves as the primary foundation for well and production data. Each state requires a different integration approach:\n\n**Texas RRC (Railroad Commission) -- Bulk Download:**\n- **Approach:** Scheduled download of bulk data files from RRC website. Parse ASCII and CSV formats into the normalized internal schema.\n- **Key Datasets:** Monthly production data (oil, gas, casinghead gas, condensate by lease), well data (API number, location, status, operator, field), drilling permits, completion data, field rules.\n- **Update Cadence:** Weekly well data refresh; monthly production data refresh.\n- **Technical Details:** RRC bulk files use fixed-width ASCII for some datasets. Build a robust parser that handles format variations. Incremental updates via date-filtered downloads (RRC provides \"changed since\" date ranges on some datasets). Store raw files for audit trail.\n- **Coverage:** Permian (Midland sub-basin), Eagle Ford, TX-side Haynesville.\n\n**New Mexico OCD -- REST API:**\n- **Approach:** Direct API integration with the OCD Hub (ArcGIS REST API).\n- **Endpoint:** https://api.emnrd.nm.gov/\n- **Key Datasets:** Oil and gas wells (location, status, API number, operator), OG Statistics (monthly production by well), well injection totals.\n- **Formats:** JSON (primary), CSV, GeoJSON for spatial queries.\n- **Technical Details:** Paginated API responses. Implement cursor-based pagination for large result sets. Rate limiting is unspecified -- implement conservative polling with exponential backoff. GeoJSON support enables spatial queries for analog well search by radius.\n- **Supplemental Sources:** OCD Well Search tool for completions, formation tops, casing, perfs. NM Tech Octane Database for additional production data cross-reference.\n- **Coverage:** Permian (Delaware sub-basin in SE NM).\n\n**Wyoming WOGCC -- REST API:**\n- **Approach:** Direct API integration with the WOGCC Data Explorer.\n- **Key Datasets:** Well info (API number, location, status, operator, formation), permits, monthly production data.\n- **Formats:** CSV, GeoJSON, JSON.\n- **Technical Details:** Similar pagination and rate-limiting considerations as NM OCD. Wyoming Geospatial Hub provides bulk download as a fallback if API is unavailable. Implement dual-path: API for incremental updates, bulk download for initial load or recovery.\n- **Coverage:** Powder River Basin.\n\n**Louisiana SONRIS -- Fallback to Enverus:**\n- **Approach:** Enverus CSV import is the primary data path for Louisiana data. SONRIS does not offer a reliable programmatic API.\n- **Known Issues:** ArcGIS MapServer endpoint exists but SSL certificate is expired. Web-based Interactive Data Reports are available but not API-accessible. DODA export tool appears internal/government-only.\n- **Mitigation:** Contact LA DNR directly about bulk data access as a future improvement. Monitor SONRIS for API availability. In the interim, Enverus CSV provides complete coverage for Haynesville wells.\n- **Coverage:** Haynesville (Louisiana side).\n\n**Unified Data Normalization Layer:**\n- All state data and Enverus CSV imports are ingested into a common normalized schema.\n- Downstream components (analog selection, type curve engine, DOI cross-reference, breakeven calculations) query the normalized layer and are agnostic to the original data source.\n- Each record in the normalized layer carries a source provenance tag (e.g., \"TX_RRC\", \"NM_OCD\", \"WY_WOGCC\", \"ENVERUS_CSV\") for data quality tracking.\n- Deduplication by API number across sources. When the same well appears in both state data and Enverus, the system retains both records and flags conflicts for analyst review. State data is treated as authoritative for regulatory fields (status, permits, production); Enverus is authoritative for enriched fields (completions detail, directional surveys).\n\n**Data Sync Scheduling:**\n- TX RRC: Weekly automated download (well data), monthly (production)\n- NM OCD: Daily API sync (configurable)\n- WY WOGCC: Daily API sync (configurable)\n- Enverus CSV: Manual upload / batch import (unchanged)\n- Admin dashboard shows last-sync timestamp and record counts per source\n\n### 11.3 PDF Parsing for AFE Documents\n\n**Challenge:** AFE documents are semi-structured PDFs that vary by operator. The client receives AFEs from approximately 50 operators in PDF format. Some are digitally generated (text-selectable), others may be scanned images.\n\n**Approach (Hybrid -- recommended for MVP):**\n- Use a vision-language model (e.g., GPT-4 Vision, Claude) to interpret the AFE document\n- The model extracts fields based on a prompt template describing expected fields\n- Handles layout variability without training custom models\n- Falls back to manual entry if confidence is low\n\n**Key Fields to Extract:**\n- API number, well name, operator\n- Legal description (section, township, range, survey)\n- Formation/target zone\n- Proposed total depth, lateral length\n- Working interest percentage\n- Estimated total cost (intangible, tangible, total)\n- Estimated spud date, completion date\n\n### 11.4 Email Auto-Ingestion (New in v2.0)\n\n**Challenge:** AFEs arrive via email to a shared inbox. The system must monitor this inbox, identify AFE-related messages, extract PDF attachments, and queue them for processing.\n\n**Approach:**\n- **Email Integration:** Connect to the shared inbox via IMAP, Microsoft Graph API (for Outlook/M365), or Google Workspace API\n- **Classification:** Simple rule-based classification (sender domain matches known operator domains, subject line keywords, PDF attachment present) supplemented by AI classification for edge cases\n- **Queuing:** Detected AFEs are queued in a \"pending confirmation\" state. The Land Analyst sees them in their inbox within the app and clicks to confirm ingestion, triggering the parsing pipeline.\n- **False Positive Handling:** Non-AFE emails that are incorrectly classified can be dismissed by the Land Analyst. The system learns from dismissals over time (future ML enhancement).\n\n### 11.5 Commodity Pricing\n\n**MVP Approach: Fixed Price Deck (User-Configurable)**\n\nFor MVP, commodity pricing uses a fixed price deck configured by the Admin (with adjustments by the Commercial Analyst per evaluation):\n\n- User sets flat prices for WTI crude oil ($/bbl) and Henry Hub natural gas ($/Mcf)\n- Optionally configure an escalation schedule (e.g., 2% annual price increase)\n- Apply basin-specific differentials (e.g., Permian basis differential to WTI)\n- Price deck is stored per evaluation and can be updated at any time before sign-off\n\n**Future: Live Pricing Feeds (v2+)**\n\nLive pricing from EIA and CME is planned as a post-MVP enhancement:\n- **EIA Open Data API:** Free with registration, provides daily WTI and Henry Hub spot prices with 1 business day lag.\n- **CME Group:** Daily settlement prices for WTI and Henry Hub futures. Suitable for futures strip pricing.\n\n### 11.6 Public Opex Benchmarking\n\n**Challenge:** Operating expense data for specific operators and basins is not freely available in a structured, API-accessible format.\n\n**Approach for MVP:**\n- Curate a baseline opex dataset from public filings for major operators and basins\n- Store as a lookup table: operator + basin + year --> LOE/BOE\n- Technical Analyst provides well-specific opex assumptions that may override or supplement benchmarks\n- Allow manual override for any well\n- Future: automated extraction from 10-K filings using NLP\n\n**Typical Opex Ranges (for reference -- target basins):**\n- Permian Basin (Delaware/SE NM + Midland/West TX): $6-12/BOE\n- Eagle Ford (South TX): $7-13/BOE\n- Haynesville (LA/East TX): $5-10/BOE (primarily gas)\n- Powder River Basin (WY): $8-14/BOE\n\n### 11.7 Type Curve Methodology\n\n**Standard Approach:**\n1. Select analog wells based on multi-criteria similarity scoring\n2. Normalize production histories to a common time-zero (first production month)\n3. Fit Arps decline curves to the normalized data (exponential, hyperbolic, harmonic, or modified hyperbolic)\n4. Generate P10/P50/P90 from the distribution of analog well outcomes\n5. Extend forecast to economic limit or specified time horizon (typically 30-50 years for unconventional wells)\n\n**Implementation Considerations:**\n- Robust curve fitting (scipy.optimize or equivalent)\n- Multi-phase production (oil + gas + water) -- type curve for each phase\n- Account for shut-in periods, rate restrictions, and data quality issues\n- Allow for manual adjustment of decline parameters\n\n### 11.8 SMS Integration (New in v2.0)\n\n**Capability:** SMS-based delegation and notification for the approval chain.\n\n**Approach:**\n- Use a cloud SMS gateway (Twilio, AWS SNS, or equivalent) for outbound notifications and inbound delegation commands\n- **Outbound:** Escalation alerts, deadline warnings, approval reminders\n- **Inbound:** Simple command parsing -- \"DELEGATE\" to pass approval to next delegate, \"APPROVE\" / \"DECLINE\" for quick action (with confirmation step)\n- **Security:** SMS actions require a confirmation step (e.g., \"Reply YES to confirm APPROVE for [Well Name]\")\n- **Audit:** All SMS interactions are logged in the notification/decision audit trail\n\n### 11.9 Notification System Architecture (New in v2.0)\n\n**Multi-Channel Notifications:**\n\n| Event | In-App | Email | SMS |\n|-------|--------|-------|-----|\n| AFE auto-detected in inbox | Land Analyst | Land Analyst | -- |\n| AFE ingested, ready for analysis | Land + Technical | Land + Technical | -- |\n| Analyst sign-off completed | Next stage analyst, CAG | Next stage analyst | -- |\n| Dashboard published (all analysts signed off) | CAG, Approver | CAG, Approver | Approver |\n| CAG vote cast | CAG members, Approver | -- | -- |\n| Approval needed (initial) | Approver | Approver | -- |\n| Escalation triggered (deadline approaching) | Next delegate | Next delegate | Next delegate |\n| Urgent escalation (close to deadline) | All in chain | All in chain | All in chain |\n| Decision made (Drill/Drop) | All roles | All roles | -- |\n| Non-Consent flagged | All roles | All roles | Approver + delegates |\n| Send Back from Approver | Target analyst | Target analyst | Target analyst |\n\n**Urgency Gradient:**\n- Normal cadence: single notification per event\n- Approaching deadline (configurable threshold, e.g., 7 days): daily reminders\n- Urgent (configurable threshold, e.g., 3 days): twice-daily reminders + SMS\n- Critical (configurable threshold, e.g., 1 day): hourly reminders + SMS\n\n### 11.10 Deployment\n\n**Cloud-hosted deployment confirmed.** No data sensitivity constraints. The application will be deployed as a cloud-hosted web application accessible via browser.\n\n**UI Design:** Light theme, modern, clean, professional design. Mobile-responsive from day one to support executive use on phones and tablets.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Risks & Assumptions\n\n### Risks\n\n| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n|---|------|-----------|--------|------------|\n| R1 | Enverus CSV export format changes or is inconsistent across data types | Medium | Medium | Build flexible column mapping with validation. Document expected formats. Test with sample exports early. |\n| R2 | AFE PDF formats vary too widely for reliable automated extraction (~50 operators) | Medium-High | Medium | Start with the most common operator formats. Allow manual correction. Use vision-language model approach for flexibility. |\n| R3 | Analog well selection produces poor type curves in data-sparse areas | Medium | High | Allow analyst override of analogs. Show confidence metrics. Support manual type curve entry as fallback. |\n| R4 | Opex benchmarking data is stale or inaccurate for specific operators | High | Medium | Provide clear sourcing for all opex data. Technical Analyst provides per-well assumptions. Manual override. Plan for future automated extraction. |\n| R5 | Economics engine complexity (deal structure builder + auto-calc) exceeds estimated development time | High | High | Prioritize standard WI/NRI and back-in after payout first. Build remaining deal structures incrementally. Design the engine for extensibility from the start. |\n| R6 | User adoption resistance (analysts prefer existing Excel workflows) | Medium | High | Design for augmentation, not replacement. Allow export to Excel. Phase rollout by role. |\n| R7 | Scope creep from post-drill variance analysis and portfolio optimization | Medium | Medium | Clear MVP boundary. Contractual phase separation. |\n| R8 | Election window timing pressure -- system must deliver same-day results | Medium | High | Parallel workflow reduces elapsed time. Target same-day automated evaluation. Analyst review is the bottleneck, not the system. |\n| R9 | Mobile-responsive design adds UI development time | Medium | Medium | Use a responsive CSS framework from the start. Test on mobile devices throughout development. |\n| R10 | Custom one-off deal structures are too varied to generalize into a builder UI | Medium | High | Start with the most common patterns. Provide a flexible \"custom\" mode. Gather real examples from the client early. |\n| R11 | Email auto-ingestion produces false positives/negatives in AFE detection | Medium | Medium | Start with rule-based classification (sender, subject, attachment). Land Analyst confirms all auto-detected AFEs before processing. Manual upload as fallback. |\n| R12 | SMS integration introduces security risks (unauthorized delegation/approval) | Low | High | Require confirmation step for all SMS actions. Log all interactions. Consider two-factor confirmation for approval actions. |\n| R13 | CAG voting adoption is low or perfunctory (one-word rationale) | Medium | Medium | Enforce minimum rationale length. Make the voting interface frictionless. Show CAG members that their input influences decisions. |\n| R14 | Approval chain escalation annoys senior executives with too many notifications | Medium | Medium | Configurable notification preferences per user. Respect \"quiet hours\" settings. Allow snooze. Clearly communicate urgency thresholds. |\n| R15 | Live dashboard recalculation performance is slow with complex deal structures | Medium | High | Optimize economics engine for sub-second recalculation. Pre-compute sensitivity ranges. Use WebSocket for real-time updates. |\n| R16 | Non-consent tracking creates legal/compliance concerns | Low | Medium | App is decision support only -- does not execute elections or operator communications. Clear disclaimers. Legal review of non-consent flagging language. |\n| R17 | State regulatory data formats change without notice (TX RRC ASCII, NM/WY API schemas) | Medium | Medium | Version parsers per state. Monitor state agency release notes. Automated format-change detection on import. Enverus CSV as fallback. |\n| R18 | State API rate limits or availability issues (NM OCD, WY WOGCC) | Medium | Medium | Implement exponential backoff. Cache data locally. Fall back to Enverus CSV if API is down. Bulk download as secondary path. |\n| R19 | Data quality inconsistency across multiple state sources and Enverus | Medium | High | Unified normalization layer with source provenance tags. Deduplication by API number. Conflict flagging for analyst review. Automated data quality metrics per source. |\n| R20 | Louisiana SONRIS never provides programmatic access | High | Medium | Enverus CSV is the confirmed fallback for LA/Haynesville. Monitor SONRIS. Contact LA DNR periodically. Low impact since Enverus covers the gap. |\n\n### Assumptions\n\n| # | Assumption | Impact if Wrong |\n|---|-----------|-----------------|\n| A1 | Client has an active Enverus subscription that allows CSV data export | No well data available without Enverus; must identify alternative data source |\n| A2 | AFE PDFs are primarily digitally generated (text-selectable), not handwritten or poor-quality scans | OCR accuracy drops significantly for scanned documents; may need different parsing strategy |\n| A3 | The client's DOI deck (master land records) is maintained in a single master Excel spreadsheet that is reasonably clean and structured | Significant data cleaning effort or multi-source reconciliation may be required |\n| A4 | The client evaluates primarily US onshore unconventional wells in the Permian, Eagle Ford, Haynesville, and Powder River basins | Type curve methodology and opex benchmarks are calibrated for these basins. Other basins require additional data curation |\n| A5 | Users are comfortable with web-based, cloud-hosted applications accessed via browser | If they require desktop or on-premise only, architecture changes significantly |\n| A6 | The deal structures encountered in practice can be modeled with the predefined templates plus a custom builder | If every deal is truly unique with no patterns, the builder becomes impractical |\n| A7 | The shared inbox for AFE receipt is an email system accessible via API (M365, Google Workspace, or IMAP) | If the inbox is not API-accessible, email auto-ingestion falls back to manual upload only |\n| A8 | SMS-capable phone numbers are available for all users in the approval chain | If not, escalation relies on in-app and email only; SMS delegation is not available |\n| A9 | The client's approval hierarchy has at most 3 levels (primary + 2 delegates) | More levels would require extending the approval chain configuration |\n| A10 | CAG membership is stable enough that votes are meaningful (not constantly changing personnel) | Frequent CAG turnover would reduce the value of voting trend analysis |\n| A11 | The client is willing to start with a curated opex dataset and refine over time | If they demand highly accurate opex from day one, significant data curation effort is front-loaded |\n| A12 | Free state regulatory data (TX RRC, NM OCD, WY WOGCC) remains freely available and the formats remain reasonably stable | If states restrict access or change formats significantly, fall back to Enverus CSV for affected states |\n| A13 | NM OCD and WY WOGCC REST APIs have sufficient uptime and rate limits for production use | If APIs are unreliable, bulk download fallback paths are available for both states |\n\n---\n\n## 13.

Approver uses judgment |\n\n### MVP Delivery Strategy\n\nThe MVP should be delivered iteratively within the following rough phases:\n\n1. **Foundation (Weeks 1-4):** Data model (including operator scorecard and decision outcome data models), auth, 6-role management, DOI deck upload, state regulatory data integration (TX RRC parser, NM OCD API client, WY WOGCC API client), unified data normalization layer, Enverus CSV import engine, basic UI shell with responsive framework, notification infrastructure\n2. **Land + Technical (Weeks 4-8):** AFE parsing with PDF template library (including email auto-ingestion), land matching, DOI cross-reference (from normalized data layer), discrepancy workflow, confidence sign-off with auto-gating; analog search (from normalized data), scoring algorithm, type curve engine, opex input, technical review UI, confidence sign-off. **These two workstreams can be developed in parallel.**\n3. **Economics Engine (Weeks 8-12):** Engine-driven auto-calculation with breakeven auto-calculation, Commercial Analyst validation UI, deal structure builder (standard WI/NRI, back-in, sliding scale, min royalty, promoted, custom), pricing, opex integration, key metrics, full cash flow analysis\n4. **Dashboard + Voting (Weeks 12-15):** Comprehensive deal dashboard (live interactive), all chart/table components, breakeven display, asymmetric risk framing panel, recommendation engine with rationale, CAG voting system with rationale, scenario controls, live recalculation, deadline-aware prioritization (color coding, urgency sorting)\n5. **Approval Chain + Notifications (Weeks 15-17):** Delegated approval chain, Send Back workflow, SMS integration, notification system (in-app, email, SMS), urgency escalation, non-consent handling, stale evaluation detection, confidence auto-gating workflow\n6. **Export + Integration & Polish (Weeks 17-20):** Export package (PDF, Excel, slide), end-to-end testing, mobile responsiveness testing, performance optimization (dashboard recalculation speed), historical import, decision archive, state data sync verification, user acceptance testing\n\n*Total estimated timeline: 20 weeks (expanded from 18 weeks due to state regulatory data integration, PDF template library, breakeven auto-calculation, asymmetric risk framing, stale evaluation detection, confidence auto-gating, export package, and decision outcome data model). Timeline is indicative and will be refined during planning.*\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n| Requirement | Target |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Automated evaluation time (land + technical + economics) | Same-day results (< 4 hours for automated stages); parallel processing reduces wall-clock time |\n| Dashboard recalculation speed | < 2 seconds for full model recalculation when inputs change |\n| Analyst review turnaround | Supported by clear notifications and streamlined review UI |\n| Notification delivery | In-app: real-time; Email: < 5 minutes; SMS: < 1 minute |\n| Deployment model | Cloud-hosted, browser-based |\n| Device support | Desktop, tablet, and mobile phone (responsive) |\n| User scale | Multiple users per role (especially CAG); architecture supports growth |\n| Data refresh | Automated sync for state data (daily/weekly); manual CSV upload for Enverus; event-driven for AFE PDFs |\n| UI design | Light theme, modern, clean, professional |\n| SMS reliability | 99.9% delivery via cloud SMS gateway |\n\n---\n\n## 14. Open Questions\n\n### Critical (Must Resolve Before Development)\n\n1. **Enverus CSV Export Access:** **RESOLVED** -- Enverus CSV import is the primary data path for v1. API is the upgrade path. Client can export CSV data from their Enverus subscription.\n\n2. **Land Record Format:** **RESOLVED** -- Single master Excel spreadsheet (DOI deck) for land records, confirmed.\n\n3. **AFE Volume:** **RESOLVED** -- 3-5 AFEs per month from approximately 50 operators, PDF format.\n\n4. **AFE Format Variability:** **RESOLVED** -- ~50 operators, AFEs arrive in PDF format. Vision-language model approach will handle variability.\n\n5. **Deployment Preference:** **RESOLVED** -- Cloud-hosted deployment confirmed. No data sensitivity constraints.\n\n6. **Data Sensitivity:** **RESOLVED** -- No data sensitivity constraints. Cloud-hosted with standard cloud AI services is acceptable.\n\n### Important (Should Resolve During Early Development)\n\n7. **Internal Opex Data:** Does the client have internal opex data for wells they have participated in historically? This would supplement public benchmarks and Technical Analyst assumptions.\n\n8. **Type Curve Methodology Preferences:** Does the client's technical team have specific preferences for decline curve models, b-factor constraints, or terminal decline rates?\n\n9. **Economic Model Complexity:** **RESOLVED** -- Must support back-in after payout, sliding scale overrides, minimum royalties, promoted interest structures, and custom one-off deal structures. Engine-driven auto-calculation with Commercial Analyst validation.\n\n10. **User Count:** **RESOLVED (Updated)** -- Multiple users per role, especially for CAG (advisory group). Architecture must support concurrent CAG access to the live dashboard and voting.\n\n11. **Existing Tool Integration:** **RESOLVED** -- No existing tool integrations required.\n\n12. **Historical Decision Data:** **RESOLVED** -- Build a spreadsheet import path for seeding the decision archive.\n\n13. **Email System for Auto-Ingestion (New):** What email system does the client use for the shared AFE inbox? Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, or other? This determines the email integration API. Is API access to the inbox available?\n\n14. **Approval Chain Depth (New):** Is a 3-level chain (Primary + 2 Delegates) sufficient? Are there scenarios requiring more levels?\n\n15. **CAG Composition (New):** How many members are typically in the Commercial Advisory Group? Is membership fixed or does it vary by AFE? Are external advisors included?\n\n16. **SMS Provider Preference (New):** Does the client have an existing SMS gateway or corporate messaging platform? Twilio is the recommended default.\n\n17. **Non-Consent Penalty Data (New):** Are non-consent penalties currently tracked in the DOI deck / land records? If not, is the client willing to add this data? What does the penalty structure look like?\n\n18. **Election Deadline Source (New):** Where is the election deadline for each AFE recorded? Is it in the AFE document itself, or does the Land Analyst determine it from the operating agreement?\n\n### Nice to Know\n\n19. **Basin Focus:** **RESOLVED** -- Permian (Delaware/SE NM + Midland/West TX), Eagle Ford (South TX), Haynesville (LA/East TX), Powder River Basin (WY).\n\n20. **Election Window Timing:** **RESOLVED** -- 30 days typical, 1 week worst case. Target same-day automated results.\n\n21. **Chat Interface Expectations:** **RESOLVED** -- Conversational AI deferred to post-MVP. Predefined scenario controls only for v1.\n\n---\n\n## 15. GO/NO-GO Conditions\n\n### GO Conditions (All Must Be True)\n\n| # | Condition | Verification Method | Status |\n|---|-----------|-------------------|--------|\n| G1 | Enverus CSV export access confirmed | Client confirms CSV export capability | **Confirmed** |\n| G2 | Client provides sample AFE documents (minimum 3 different operator formats) for parsing validation | Document delivery | Pending |\n| G3 | Client provides sample DOI deck (single master Excel) for schema mapping | Document delivery | Pending |\n| G4 | Client agrees to web-based (browser) delivery for MVP | Written confirmation | **Confirmed** |\n| G5 | Client identifies users for each of the 6 roles for UAT | Named users confirmed | Pending |\n| G6 | Cloud-hosted deployment model agreed | Written confirmation | **Confirmed** |\n| G7 | Client confirms the parallel workflow with 6 roles accurately represents their evaluation process | Workshop sign-off | Pending |\n| G8 | MVP scope boundary is agreed upon (in-scope vs. deferred features) including voting, approval chain, and live dashboard | Written sign-off | Pending |\n| G9 | Budget and timeline are approved for MVP delivery (20-week estimate) | Contract execution | Pending |\n| G10 | Client provides sample deal structure examples for economics engine validation | Document delivery | Pending |\n| G11 | Client confirms email system and API access for shared inbox (auto-ingestion) | Technical validation | Pending |\n| G12 | Client confirms approval chain structure and delegate assignments | Workshop documentation | Pending |\n| G13 | Client confirms CAG membership list and voting process alignment | Workshop documentation | Pending |\n\n### NO-GO Conditions (Any One Kills the Project)\n\n| # | Condition | Why It Kills |\n|---|-----------|-------------|\n| N1 | Client's Enverus subscription does not include well production data AND they cannot provide CSV exports | No production data = no type curves = no economics = no value |\n| N2 | Client's AFE volume is < 5/year | The tool's value proposition requires sufficient volume to justify the investment; at < 5 AFEs/year, manual evaluation is adequate |\n| N3 | Client requires international well evaluation (non-US) in v1 | Type curve methodology, opex benchmarks, and data sources are all calibrated for US onshore; international would require fundamental re-architecture |\n| N4 | Client cannot provide land records in any structured format | No land records = no DOI validation = the entire pipeline breaks at Stage 1 |\n\n### Conditional GO (Proceed with Adjusted Scope)\n\n| # | Condition | Scope Adjustment |\n|---|-----------|-----------------|\n| C1 | Deal structure examples reveal complexity beyond what the builder can handle | Add custom calculation scripting capability; extend economics phase by 2-3 weeks |\n| C2 | AFE formats are highly variable across all 50 operators | Add 2-3 weeks for parser training/tuning; build a manual correction UI as primary fallback |\n| C3 | Client wants Enverus API integration in v1 (not just CSV) | Extend timeline by 2-3 weeks; verify API subscription and costs |\n| C4 | Client wants conversational AI in v1 | Extend timeline by 4-5 weeks; increase budget for NLU development |\n| C5 | Email inbox is not API-accessible (cannot auto-ingest) | Drop email auto-ingestion; manual upload only. Reduces scope by ~1 week. |\n| C6 | Client has no SMS infrastructure or phone numbers for executives | Drop SMS delegation/notification; rely on in-app + email escalation only. Reduces scope by ~1 week. |\n| C7 | CAG membership exceeds 10 people per AFE | May require pagination/filtering in the voting summary; add ~1 week for voting UI scaling. |\n\n---\n\n## 16. BA Optimization Recommendations -- Client Decisions\n\nThis section documents 12 expert recommendations proposed during discovery, along with the client's decisions on each. Items approved for v1 have been integrated into the relevant sections of this document (Sections 5, 7, 8, 9, 13). Items approved for v2 have corresponding data model provisions in v1 (Section 6). Deferred and skipped items are retained for future reference.\n\n### Decision Summary\n\n| # | Recommendation | Client Decision | Integration |\n|---|---------------|----------------|-------------|\n| 1 | Weighted Confidence Auto-Gating | **Approved v1** | Sections 5, 7, 13 |\n| 2 | Deadline-Aware Prioritization | **Approved v1** | Sections 5, 7, 13 |\n| 3 | Quick Take Pre-Screen | **Skipped** | Not implemented -- every AFE runs the full process |\n| 4 | Breakeven Auto-Calculation | **Approved v1** | Sections 7, 8, 9, 13 |\n| 5 | Operator Performance Scorecards | **Approved v2** | Data model in v1 (Section 6); UI deferred to v2 |\n| 6 | Asymmetric Risk Framing | **Approved v1** | Sections 7, 9, 13 |\n| 7 | Analyst Workload Dashboard | **Deferred** | Analyst roles may change as integrations become seamless |\n| 8 | CAG Vote Weighting | **Deferred** | Equal votes in MVP; Approver uses judgment |\n| 9 | Stale Evaluation Detection | **Approved v1** | Sections 5, 7, 13 |\n| 10 | Decision Feedback Loop | **Approved v1** (data model only) | Data model in Section 6; no UI in v1 |\n| 11 | PDF Template Library | **Approved v1** | Sections 7, 8, 13 |\n| 12 | Export Package | **Approved v1** | Sections 7, 13 |\n\n### 16.1 Weighted Confidence Auto-Gating -- APPROVED v1\n\nIf any analyst (Land, Technical, or Commercial) signs off with **Low** confidence, the system auto-flags the evaluation to the Approver requiring explicit acknowledgment of the uncertainty. The Approver must annotate that they have reviewed and accepted the risk before making a final decision. This transforms confidence from a passive indicator into an active workflow gate that forces scrutiny on uncertain evaluations while allowing clear-cut decisions to proceed efficiently.\n\n### 16.2 Deadline-Aware Prioritization -- APPROVED v1\n\nAll workflow views (analyst queues, CAG dashboard, Approver inbox) are sorted by election deadline urgency by default. Color-coded urgency indicators throughout the UI: green (>14 days), amber (7-14 days), red (<3 days). Proactive alerts when processing time estimates suggest a deadline is at risk. The system becomes deadline-aware rather than FIFO, preventing the scenario where harder AFEs miss deadlines while easier ones are processed first.\n\n### 16.3 Quick Take Pre-Screen -- SKIPPED\n\nClient decision: every AFE runs the full evaluation process. No fast-track or pre-screening. This ensures consistent rigor across all evaluations regardless of apparent complexity.\n\n### 16.4 Breakeven Auto-Calculation -- APPROVED v1\n\nAuto-compute breakeven oil price, gas price, capex, opex, and minimum WI for every deal (NPV = 0). Display on the dashboard alongside the economics summary. Include \"margin of safety\" framing in the recommendation rationale (e.g., \"Current oil price of $70/bbl is $18/bbl above the breakeven price of $52/bbl, providing a 35% margin of safety\"). Answers the most common executive question without manual scenario iteration.\n\n### 16.5 Operator Performance Scorecards -- APPROVED v2\n\nClient wants the full scorecard UI in v2 but recognizes the data model must be designed in v1 to accumulate operator performance data from day one. The v1 data model includes: operator entity with performance tracking fields (average EUR, IP-30, IP-90, completion consistency, DOI accuracy), relationships to wells and AFE evaluations. Data accumulates automatically; the v2 UI will surface it as scorecards alongside AFE evaluations.\n\n### 16.6 Asymmetric Risk Framing -- APPROVED v1\n\nP10 upside vs P90 downside with regret analysis displayed on the dashboard. Presented as a 2x2 decision matrix (Drill vs. Drop at P10 vs. P90) with maximum loss (dry hole capex exposure). Shifts the decision frame to \"is the risk-reward acceptable?\" -- how sophisticated capital allocators think. All values update live with other dashboard components.\n\n### 16.7 Analyst Workload Dashboard -- DEFERRED\n\nClient notes that analyst roles may evolve or be reduced as state data integrations and automation become more seamless. Revisit when role structure stabilizes post-MVP.\n\n### 16.8 CAG Vote Weighting -- DEFERRED\n\nEqual votes in MVP. The Approver uses their own judgment to weight advisory input by expertise. May revisit in v2 if the CAG grows large enough to warrant formal weighting.\n\n### 16.9 Stale Evaluation Detection -- APPROVED v1\n\nFlag evaluations with no activity for a configurable period. Notify the Admin and assigned analyst. If the evaluation is stale and the deadline is approaching, auto-escalate to the Admin with a recommendation to reassign. Track stale evaluations as a metric in admin views. Complements deadline-aware prioritization by catching evaluations that fall through the cracks.\n\n### 16.10 Decision Outcome Feedback Loop -- APPROVED v1 (Data Model Only)\n\nBuild the data plumbing in v1: for every \"Drill\" decision, create a pending Outcome Record expecting future production data. Import mechanism for actual data (same state data + Enverus CSV paths). Auto-match to historical decisions by API number. Status tags on archived decisions: \"Awaiting Production Data\" / \"Production Data Available\" / \"Not Applicable (Dropped).\" No variance analysis UI in v1 -- data collection only to eliminate the cold-start problem for v2 analytics.\n\n### 16.11 PDF Template Library -- APPROVED v1\n\nAfter a successful parse, store the extraction mapping as a template for that operator. Future AFEs from the same operator use template-based extraction first (fast, cheap, deterministic). Fall back to the vision-language model only for new operators or template mismatches. Over time, the library covers most incoming AFEs (~50 operators), reducing AI API costs and improving processing speed.\n\n### 16.12 Export Package -- APPROVED v1\n\nOne-click export generating: PDF report with all dashboard components (charts, tables, economics, recommendation, confidence levels, voting summary), Excel workbook with the full economic model (for audit), and executive summary slide (single-page for board presentation). Reflects the current dashboard state including any scenario adjustments. Replaces ad hoc email and slide deck creation for JV partner and board communication.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Glossary\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|------|-----------|\n| AFE | Authorization for Expenditure -- a formal document from an operator proposing a well and requesting capital commitment from working interest partners |\n| API Number | American Petroleum Institute well identification number -- a unique numeric identifier for every well drilled in the US |\n| Arps Decline | A set of empirical decline curve models (exponential, hyperbolic, harmonic) developed by J.J.
