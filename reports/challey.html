  document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = marked.parse("# Challey Project Summary Report\n## Business Analyst Discovery Phase — Executive Brief\n\n**Project:** Challey (Chore Tracking App)\n**Client:** Maggie, age 13\n**Report Date:** February 10, 2026\n**Phase:** Discovery (Skills 1-8 Complete)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Project Overview\n\n**The Problem:**\nMaggie enjoys doing chores but has no effective way to report completed work to her parents. She wants recognition for her contributions and clear communication about rewards.\n\n**The Solution:**\nChalley is a teen-friendly chore tracking app with a simple workflow:\n1. Parent assigns chore with reward\n2. Teen completes and marks done\n3. Parent verifies work\n4. Reward granted\n\n**Target Users:**\n- **Primary:** Teenagers (13-17) who want recognition and rewards\n- **Secondary:** Parents who need better household task delegation\n\n---\n\n## 2. Market Analysis\n\n### Competitive Landscape\n\nThe chore app market is crowded with 15+ established players in three categories:\n\n**1. Financial Education Apps** (Greenlight, BusyKid, Homey)\n- Focus: Banking, allowance, savings goals, investment education\n- Pricing: $5-$15/month subscriptions\n- Weakness: Expensive, complex for simple chore tracking needs\n\n**2. Comprehensive Household Managers** (S'moresUp, Family Daily, OurHome)\n- Focus: Chores + calendars + grocery lists + messaging + IoT\n- Pricing: Free basic, $5/month premium\n- Weakness: Feature bloat, overwhelming for teens wanting simplicity\n\n**3. Simple Chore Trackers** (Chorsee, Neat Kid, Family Tools)\n- Focus: Core chore assignment and completion tracking\n- Pricing: Free or low-cost ($2-$5)\n- Weakness: Kid-focused design (cartoons, gamification), not teen-appropriate\n\n### Market Opportunity\n\n**What's Missing:**\n- Teen-first design (mature, respectful interface)\n- Recognition focus (not just money/points)\n- True simplicity (no feature creep)\n- Low/no-cost entry point\n\n**Challey's Positioning:**\n\"The simple, fast chore tracker for teens who want their work recognized.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. User Insights\n\n### The Teen User (Maggie's Perspective)\n\n**Key Needs:**\n- Show parents what I've accomplished\n- See rewards I can earn\n- Quick \"mark done\" action\n- Feel valued and appreciated\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- Parents don't notice completed work\n- Forget which chores have rewards\n- Complex apps are annoying\n- Feeling unappreciated\n\n**Quote from Research:**\n> \"Teenagers want to feel valued, and when a chore is a responsibility and not just a menial task, it can help your teen feel more important.\"\n\n### The Parent User (Dad's Perspective)\n\n**Key Needs:**\n- Fast chore assignment from phone\n- Verify work before rewarding\n- See what's done vs. pending\n- Set clear expectations upfront\n\n**Pain Points:**\n- \"I'll do it later\" syndrome\n- Constant nagging required\n- Disputes about chore quality\n- Tracking multiple kids' tasks\n\n**Quote from Research:**\n> \"While teenagers know what their chores are, they don't do them unless told, then respond with 'later, I'm busy now,' and often never get to it.\"\n\n### Critical Insight\n\nMaggie ENJOYS chores (rare!) — her problem isn't motivation, it's **communication and recognition**. This shifts our focus from gamification/rewards to visibility and acknowledgment.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Feature Recommendations\n\n### MVP-LITE (Launch Version)\n**Core workflow only — can build in 2-3 weeks:**\n\n| Feature | User | Why It's Essential |\n|---------|------|-------------------|\n| Create chore | Parent | Can't assign without this |\n| View assigned chores | Teen | Can't see what to do |\n| Mark complete | Teen | Can't report work done |\n| Verify completion | Parent | Can't confirm quality |\n| Grant reward | Parent | Closes the motivation loop |\n| User management | Both | Support parent + kid roles |\n\n**Target:** 8-10 screens, minimal complexity, proven tech stack.\n\n### MVP (Enhanced Version)\n**Add after testing with Maggie's family:**\n\n- Push notifications (new assignments, approvals)\n- Activity feed (timeline of events)\n- Reward history tracking\n- Due dates for chores\n- Parent dashboard with stats\n\n### POST-MVP (Future)\n**Defer to avoid scope creep:**\n\n- Recurring chores\n- Photo verification\n- Multiple reward types (privileges, treats)\n- Allowance integration\n- Calendar sync\n- Gamification (badges, levels)\n\n---\n\n## 5. User Flows\n\n### Flow 1: Assign Chore (Dad)\n```\nOpen app → Tap \"New Chore\" → Enter details (name, description, assignee, reward, due date)\n→ Tap \"Assign\" → Maggie notified\n```\n**Time:** < 30 seconds\n\n### Flow 2: Complete Chore (Maggie)\n```\nOpen app → See \"My Chores\" → Tap chore → Do work (offline) → Tap \"Mark Complete\"\n→ Optional: Add note → Submit → Dad notified\n```\n**Time:** 3 taps + optional note\n\n### Flow 3: Verify & Reward (Dad)\n```\nGet notification → Open app → See pending chore → Check real-world work\n→ Approve or Request Changes → Reward granted or feedback given → Maggie notified\n```\n**Time:** 2 taps (if work is good)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Technical Architecture\n\n### Recommended Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- React Native (iOS + Android from one codebase)\n- Or Progressive Web App (mobile-web, add native later)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Firebase or Supabase (real-time sync, auth, database)\n- Free tier supports small user base\n\n**Notifications:**\n- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)\n- Fallback: In-app notification center\n\n**Auth:**\n- Simple family code system (like Jackbox games)\n- Upgrade to proper auth post-MVP\n\n### Estimated Scope\n\n| Phase | Duration | Effort |\n|-------|----------|--------|\n| MVP-LITE | 2-3 weeks | 1 developer |\n| MVP | 4-5 weeks | 1 developer + designer |\n| POST-MVP | Ongoing | Based on feedback |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Risk Assessment\n\n### HIGH PRIORITY RISKS\n\n**Risk 1: Parent Adoption**\n- **Issue:** If Dad doesn't commit, app fails immediately\n- **Mitigation:** Make parent workflow ultra-fast (< 30 sec). Reliable notifications.\n\n**Risk 2: Feature Creep**\n- **Issue:** Requests for calendars, banking, etc. contradict \"simple, fast\"\n- **Mitigation:** Define MVP-LITE boundaries. Roadmap for later features.\n\n**Risk 3: Real-Time Sync**\n- **Issue:** Parent and kid on different devices, data out of sync\n- **Mitigation:** Use proven backend (Firebase). Test offline scenarios.\n\n### MEDIUM PRIORITY RISKS\n\n- **Authentication complexity:** Teens may lack email addresses\n- **Notification delivery:** Push alerts can be unreliable\n- **Reward disputes:** Arguments about whether work is \"good enough\"\n- **Competing with texts/paper:** Why use app vs. sticky notes?\n\n### LOW PRIORITY RISKS\n\n- Data privacy (COPPA/GDPR)\n- Platform fragmentation (iOS vs. Android)\n- Monetization model\n- Competitive response from big players\n\n---\n\n## 8. Success Criteria\n\n### For Maggie (Teen User)\n- ✅ Can report completed chores in < 5 taps\n- ✅ Sees rewards earned clearly\n- ✅ Feels recognized by parents\n\n### For Dad (Parent User)\n- ✅ Can assign chore in < 30 seconds\n- ✅ Gets notified when chores complete\n- ✅ Can verify quickly from phone\n\n### For Family\n- ✅ Fewer verbal reminders/arguments\n- ✅ Clear record of who did what\n- ✅ Improved household harmony\n\n---\n\n## 9. Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Next Steps\n\n**1. Feedback Agent Review (Mode 1)**\n- Present discovery findings to Maggie\n- Answer pending questions:\n  - Siblings? (affects user management)\n  - Reward types? (money vs. privileges)\n  - Auto-approve for trusted chores?\n  - Mobile vs. web priority?\n  - Both parents assign or just Dad?\n\n**2. UI/UX Prototype**\n- Design key screens (parent chore creation, kid chore view, verification flow)\n- Focus on \"teen-friendly\" aesthetic (mature, not childish)\n- Demo to Maggie for feedback\n\n**3. Feedback Agent Review (Mode 2)**\n- Get prototype approval from client\n- Iterate based on feedback\n\n**4. Technical Architecture (Phase 2)**\n- Once prototype approved, hand to Solution Architect\n- Define tech stack, data model, API design\n\n**5. Build Phase**\n- Start with MVP-LITE (6 core features)\n- Test with Maggie's family\n- Iterate to MVP based on real usage\n\n### Strategic Guidance\n\n**DO:**\n- Keep it simple (resist feature requests)\n- Prioritize speed (fast workflows win)\n- Focus on recognition (not just rewards)\n- Test early and often with real users\n\n**DON'T:**\n- Add banking/financial features (out of scope)\n- Copy kid-focused gamification (wrong audience)\n- Build recurring chores yet (nice-to-have)\n- Skip the prototype phase (need client buy-in)\n\n---\n\n## 10. Conclusion\n\nChalley has a clear value proposition: **help teens like Maggie communicate completed work and earn recognition from parents**. The market is crowded, but there's a gap for a truly simple, teen-focused tracker without feature bloat.\n\n**Key Differentiators:**\n1. Teen-centric design (mature, respectful)\n2. Recognition-first (visible accomplishments)\n3. Ultra-fast workflows (< 30 sec to assign, 3 taps to complete)\n4. Free or low-cost (accessible to teens)\n\n**Biggest Risks:**\n- Parent adoption (must be easy for Dad)\n- Feature creep (stay disciplined on scope)\n- Technical sync issues (use proven backend)\n\n**Path Forward:**\n- Get client approval on discovery (Feedback Agent)\n- Build prototype (UI/UX Designer)\n- Get prototype approval (Feedback Agent)\n- Architect solution (Solution Architect)\n- Build MVP-LITE (Developer)\n- Test with Maggie's family\n- Iterate to MVP\n\nThis is a **high-viability project** if we keep scope tight and focus on the core workflow. Maggie's \"simple, fast, awesome\" vision is achievable in 4-6 weeks with disciplined execution.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Questions for Client\n\n1. **Siblings:** Do you have brothers/sisters who would use this too?\n2. **Rewards:** Is money the only reward, or also privileges (screen time, outings)?\n3. **Trust levels:** Should Dad be able to auto-approve certain chores you do regularly?\n4. **Devices:** Do you mostly use a phone, tablet, or computer?\n5. **Parents:** Just Dad assigns chores, or Mom too?\n\n---\n\n**Report Prepared By:** Business Analyst Agent\n**For:** Project Manager (Crucible Pipeline)\n**Status:** Ready for Feedback Agent Review (Mode 1)\n**Next Step:** Schedule client review with Maggie\n\n---\n\n*This report is suitable for conversion to PDF for client presentation.*\n");
