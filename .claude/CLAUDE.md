# Crucible Dashboard

Web dashboard for viewing Crucible projects, reports, and demos. Serves as the central hub for all PMO project outputs.

## Auto-Context Protocol
When making meaningful progress on this project (completing a task, making a key decision, hitting a blocker, or ending a session), update this file with the current state. This ensures continuity across devices and sessions.
